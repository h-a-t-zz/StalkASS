Drinks are on us for the first few Benjamins! (Just don't tell Mr. Lacy!) Olivia will be dancing, no doubt.

          Chili - I made a bunch

Cheesecake - I made a pumpkin one which is my personal favorite of the varietals

Challenge - Arul keeps saying he wants to play beirut, so I'm calling his pansy ass out

We'll have a fair amount of brews on hand and enough chili to feed a small army.  I'm thinking in addition to the standard drinking game fare we should make ample use of our lawn and golf clubs, and naturally the full facilities of TFB are at our disposal.
