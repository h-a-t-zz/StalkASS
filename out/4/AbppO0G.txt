          Come watch Shadow Commander (Soleio) face off against Cobra Commander (RCox) in an epic basketball duel to the death.

Only the strongest will survive. Or the one who puts a ball in a metal circle suspended in the air more than the other.

           A lot of my friends in the technology and information security world like to complain about a lack of understanding or concern for the issues that we care about, which is why it is critical that we support members of Congress who "get it".

One of those members is Eric Swalwell. A Democrat representing the East Bay, Eric has supported legislation representing the concerns of his constituents while taking a deep interest in supporting innovation and properly balancing civil liberties with security. 

This is your chance to meet Eric, talk about the issues that concern you, and to support the kind of Congresscritter that we need to represent the Bay Area.

Suggested donations start at $250. You can read more details on how to donate here: https://goo.gl/

Mark Slee is a resident DJ and co-founder of House-Heads, a San Francisco collective throwing unique underground and private events focused on forward-thinking dance music. He is also one half of Manju Masi, a collaboration with long-time partner in crime Atish.

Born and raised outside Chicago, Mark grew up on a steady diet of electronic music. Early influences came from eclectic acts like Orbital, Aphex Twin, and Underworld, balanced against an exposure to the more dancefloor-oriented sounds of Chicago house. A student of the piano from a young age, he quickly developed a keen interest in audio production and DJing - an interest he has now cultivated for 15 years.

Living in San Francisco since 2005, Mark has evolved a style of DJing that uniquely reflects his personality. Technical and introspective, he brings a thoughtful approach to constructing sets that tickle the mind, at the same time topping things off with a healthy dose of groovy, quirky fun. Understanding audio to be one avenue of a larger experience, 2011 has seen him return to original production, crafting custom-tailored tracks for the unique events he produces with House-Heads, often complementing them with interactive LED sculptures that he also creates.
