           It's that time again. Grab some friends and take some time away from obligations to enjoy some live music and maybe a few beverages. It's a 45 minute set of new originals, the originals you know, and a few covers here and there. They're carding so don't forget your IDs. It's 21+.;

          The company is growing faster than ever. There are lots of new faces... heck, even new buildings. So, a few of the veterans thought we should bring back one of the old-school traditions to help mix things up a little more. Please join us for a friendly, company-wide poker tournament.

We're talking about a no-limit, Texas Hold'em, single-elimination tournament with ~10 tables of 10 players that all whittles down to a final table at 9pm. Celebrity card dealers will include Akhil, Bob, Boz, Ezra, Dustin, Master PFung, Soleio, Warman and Wayne, but beginners are DEFINITELY welcome, provided they spend just a little time to read up on the rules beforehand. This helps keep things moving along.

Some other key details:

* No entry free (this isn't actually gambling)
* Winner receives an iPhone
* Employees only
* Food/drinks served

If you don't want to play in the tournament, please still RSVP as a 'maybe', then come and hang out, grab a beer, heckle Adam D'Angelo out of his poker face. (Bonus prize for anybody who can actually do it.) 

Please RSVP 'yes' right away to secure a spot at one of the tables... they are nearly all full up at this point!

          'Twas the brunch before Christmas- a whole 2 weeks prior!
Come sit in our house, by our non-working fire.
Have some holiday treats at our daytime soiree.
(And what great excuse to drink during the day!)

Its not just for Christmas, it's for Hanuka too.
(We say this for Matt, our resident Jew)
Whatever your faith, there's lots of good cheer!
They'll be food and music, fun people and beer.

For our Facebook coworkers, we know that it's far...
But come make the trek, by caltrain or car.
The holiday party is the evening before,
If you're staying the night, come knock on our door.

We know you'll be hungry after the big-party fun.
So wake up, login, remove-tags, and come.
And race like a rabbit, or trudge like a tortoise,
Our location's convenient: 19th and Dolores.

Now we know what you're thinking: "The event of the season!
How could I not come? There's no reasonable reason!"
So choose "Yes", "No" or "Maybe". But don't be that guy
Who didn't respond, still "awaiting reply"..

So from Julio, from Matt, and, of course, Sarah Smith
We'd love to have you; accept invite forthwith!
To come would be awesome; to skip would be rude;
Besides... 
Given economic conditions, who'd turn down free food? :)
