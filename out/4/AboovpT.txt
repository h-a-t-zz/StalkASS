Makers Club is for anyone who makes things professionally. Designers, artists, architects, photographers, illustrators, typographers, filmmakers, writers, programmers, printers, copywriters, carpenters, etcetera are all welcome. There is no agenda, it's not for recruiting, the point is just to meet, talk, and drink with other interesting people. Simple.
