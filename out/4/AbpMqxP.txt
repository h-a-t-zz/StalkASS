Please join me for a few drinks and lots of memories as I turn in my badge and bid farewell to California Avenue.

          NOTE: this event page is only for the reception following the memorial service, which is being held just prior at 10AM at Beth Am, 26790 Arastradero Rd, Los Altos Hills, CA 94022.

Dear friends: will be holding a reception immediately following the memorial service for our dear friend and colleague Sam Felder. Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend both the service and the reception. We are looking to get a rough count of attendees for the reception so we can plan enough food and drink, but please come whether or not you've had the chance to rsvp. We all want to be together to remember Sam. Looking forward to seeing you all. 

Please note that there will likely be special instructions on where to park near my house, so stay tuned for those details. xoxo
