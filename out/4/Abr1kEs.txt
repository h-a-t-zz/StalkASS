          Labias and Gentlemen!!

It’s that time of year again- where Caits is turning and unmentionable number! We can’t believe it was approximately 10 years ago that she was sneaking into bars, making out with ugly guys, and getting drunk off wine coolers. 
So, this year we have decided to return to her roots with a wild celebration! We’ll be heading to Old Pro  for an evening of pure debauchery that will end at B412. Caitlin is going to go wild and take a shot down in only three sips!! 

 In lieu of gifts, we ask that you make a donation to the Red Cross. SIKE! Gifts are mandatory. Preferably the kind that come in a little glass and are handed to Caitlin by a bartender.

Sorry if we left you off the invite, friend lists are long, come one come all - the more the merrier.

          *A bus will now be stopping at our place to pick us up and set us on our way to the Party*

We are going to set off a pre-party soirée this Friday.  We will provide all of the alcohol and you will need to bring your choice mixer to the party.  That's right, vodka, gin, whiskey, tequila, and rum will all be in attendance along with their good friend "keg of beer."  I repeat, this is a mixer party...WE WILL HAVE NO MIXERS, other than water, so unless you want to drink your beverages straight, please raid your local Facebook building for a nice mixer.  

As always, we enjoy a good party at 923 Boyce so we hope you all will have a chance to stop by and join in the celebration before the celebration.

          Another weekend, another hotel party. This time, everyone is in for real treats:

- Theme: Graffiti on white t-shirts! We'll provide the shirts and markers (thanks to Morin for the suggestion)
- Visitors from Dublin! Michael Burke and Shawn O'Donoughue are flying in for work, but can't pass up this chance and you shouldn't either (otherwise you'll have to meet them in Menlo Park)

Same deal as usual, show up anytime after 8, have some drinks and snacks. Off to some bar/club after. +1's welcome!

          Let's be spooky. Let's have fun!
We'll scare ourselves before we're done
with ghosts and goblins - winds that howl -
Things that fly and things that prowl.
We'll talk about such creepy stuff
until we both get scared enough
to hear things that we cannot see
and see things that just cannot be.
Let's be spooky - you and me.

(by Bobbi Katz, lest you think we came up with that ourselves)

We will provide the drinks, snacks, and music. 
You will provide the monster bash. Costumes required!

Feel free to invite people
