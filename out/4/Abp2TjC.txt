          We're going to screen two cinematic masterpieces starting at 9PM. Come when you like, have a drink, watch whatever you end up watching. But look out, these are pretty riveting tales!

First up:
Fred Savage stars in "The Wizard," an American classic featuring the debut of the greatest game ever made, Super Mario Brothers 3. Arguably more important, however, is the fact that there is a supporting character named Mr. Putnam in this movie, which makes the entire thing worth watching.

Next is "Son of the Mask," a direct-to-DVD sequel to Jim Carrey's 1994 masterpiece, "The Mask". I have never seen this movie but I know that it is a) a children's movie and b) in the bottom 100 rated movies on IMDB.com. It should be a real gas!

Directions to our house from PA:
- take university toward stanford
- turn right onto el camino after you go under the bridge
- immediately get into the far left lane and turn left onto sand hill rd (first light)
- get on 280N
- take the farm hill blvd exit
- go straight down a big hill until you reach a stop sign. turn left at this stop sign (emerald hill rd)
- drive until dead end, turn left (jefferson)
- at 5-way stop sign, take hard left (lakeview way)
- house is on left just a few houses; has a driveway going down from the road, a gravel area where 4 cars will probably be parked side-by-side (try to get street parking). you will walk through a terrifying staircase with a bunch of overgrown jungle to reach our front door, which doesn't actually look like a front door

(if you take el camino north from palo alto you can just turn left on jefferson [by whole foods] and go straight until you hit the emerald hill road stop sign and turn _right_, then follow the rest of my directions)
