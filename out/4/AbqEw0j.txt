Paying homage to the base 10 nature of the year ahead (and the inspirational scientific short film of the same name) Powers of 10 will transform our dynamic 4,000 sq ft. digital art center into a series of distinct audiovisual spaces and exhibitions exploring the microscopic and macrocosmic dimensions of our collective interconnectivity. 

And for this special occasion, we are excited to have 6 channels from The Compound’s legendary sound-system at our disposal to create a truly immersive environment.

With local support from SF stalwarts Jonah Sharp, Alland Byallo and Nikola Baytala, OPEN BAR until midnight, champagne toast, hors d’œuvres, balloon drop, and a full fledged GAFFTA Membership, Powers of 10 promises to be a celebration worthy of the arrival of a new decade filled with promise and possibilities.

Powers of 10 is a Members only (21+) event. You can reserve your spot by purchasing a GAFFTA Membership at any level (see below). Membership perks include discounts on future GAFFTA events, Members-only keepsakes and the first 75 Memberships sold come with a limited edition GAFFTA pin!

All proceeds directly fund GAFFTA’s operating and production expenses, and memberships are 100% tax deductible. By becoming a GAFFTA Member you will be stakeholder in our shared vision of building social consciousness through digital culture…and what could make a better Holiday gift than a GAFFTA Membership and the hottest ticket in town?!

Capacity is strictly limited and sales are online only, so become a Member, support GAFFTA and secure your spot at the party of the (next) decade now!

          Tonight (Monday March 30) at 7 PM we’re opening up the new Automattic space at Pier 38 for the first time because so many of our friends will be in town for Web 2.0 Expo and all their fun events. Come by our spot (on Embarcadero in between Brannan and Townsend) starting at 7 PM and enjoy good music, free booze, and geeky friends. We’re on the left corner and there’s a bunch of circles in the window and an Automattic sign over the door. (Sorry for the late announcement, if you could help us get the word out I’d appreciate it.)

The long version: 
I'm setting aside all shame and inviting every single one of my Facebook friends to this event b/
          
          
          
          
          
          c my team worked very hard on this. Feel free to unfriend me if you can't remember who I am &lt;3

This game is not for everyone, but we want to find the people who like clicking on cute babies and dressing them up with 1,500+ pieces of clothing and decorating their rooms with 1,500+ pieces of furniture and decoration. 

We're genuinely excited to share this with you all, and appreciate all the support you've given us to this point. Thank you, we hope you enjoy the game and tell your friends about it too =)

Also, for those of you counting, we're giving 10% of all our revenues to child-focused charities, starting with Love146 (www.love146.org) and Room to Read (www.roomtoread.org). We want to do everything right, and that's just one part of it.

Cheers and God bless my friends,
-Brian
