          Brought to you by HBLSA, ACS and CHH. Dinner will be provided.

This program will be an insightful, moderated discourse between two renowned practitioners on the topic of whether progressives should, or even can, be prosecutors. Overall, we hope the "Progressive Prosecutors" program allows for a robust dialogue and exchange of ideas about the ever-important topic of criminal law. We hope this event elucidates the choices made and vantage points held by our guests. Moreover, we hope this program offers a clear vision to attending students of what ideas, realities, and opportunities should animate their thinking as they approach potential careers in criminal law.

A: We do and yes.  Incidentally, sounds like you won't be at the after party.

          Let's celebrate the man, the myth, the legend that we all know and love turning 25. He can be harsh with us sometimes, but it's because he loves us and he's the nicest dude who can catch a frisbee and build virtual gifts.

Let's start by taking the 7:10pm PA =&gt; 8:00pm SF train.

Wait, let me back up. Let's start by buying or remembering or putting on now and never changing a cheap white t-shirt. We will bring only 2 extras for the two of you who forgot. But we will make fun of you. 

Back to where I was.

Let's start by taking the 7:10pm PA =&gt; 8:00pm SF train.

Everybody brings and downs their own six pack. The train drinking games will involve black markers and your white shirts.

Party goes till 11:30 at the Mars bar and then we get crazy. Will chen overtired, mehanical bull riding crazy. There will be DJs at the bar.

There will be will chen at the bar.
21+ to drink, under 21 can enter. No cover.

Let me repeat. There will be will chen at the bar.

There may be some light appetizers early in the night but eat before hand.

Did I mention, there will be Will Chen at the bar.

Don't forget your white tshirts. You'll know who forgot them - we'll have red markers for them.
