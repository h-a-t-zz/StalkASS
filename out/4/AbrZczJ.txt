           Come by and check out Jonathan Matas' newest work: a Porsche 911 Art Car entitled "Document Of Energy: The Immeasurable Display of Phenomena".

The car is here for everyone to see for the first time this weekend. Jonathan will be there to answer questions, talk about the creative process and discuss art- his favorite subject. 

The car was painted over the course of a month and a half, in several locations including Heron Arts in San Francisco, a Vacaville Garage, and a Santa Cruz front yard. It contains seas of detail and transparent and opaque layers of enamel paint, unlike any art car seen in the past ... It's a one of a kind piece that has to be experienced in person! 

We'll be hanging out in front of Jonathan's Mural on 741 Valencia, (next door to Tacolicious). Come by and say hi. We might even paint a few canvases.

Half of the proceeds from the sale of this car will go to an amazing charity called Watsi, which helps crowdfund for surgeries for those in need all over the world. (http://

In a bizarre twist of fate, we were both born on January 7 three years apart and this year will mark the first time we will celebrate together. 

The guest list was more or less chosen at random, so feel free to come if you see this and want to hang out.

           We've had a good month and a half to recover from the last Habanero Burger outing, so let's do it again!  

A summary of what happened last time
- Lots of wavers signed; darts thrown; spicy meat, beer, and soothing ice cream sandwiches consumed.
- David-Ezra ate four burgers, just three short of the world record in one sitting.  Can he stand the heat and become world champion?

Here's the place:
