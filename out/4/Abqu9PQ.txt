          It's that time of year again...I would love to have a drink with y'all at my favorite mission watering hole! The Cantina has graciously given us carte blanche of the backroom and I'm betting we could take over the front if we play our cards right.  I'll even offer a bribe - free chips and salsa*.  ;-)

Please join in the fun...and bring a friend or 5.  Apologies in advance if I forgot to add you out the gate and you found this via a feed, forward, or fone call at the last second.  Its not you, its me.  Really.

*There will also be other goodies like chile con queso, guacamole, quesadilla and the like.

          Game Day Spirit Week kicks off next week — so get pumped up!

Wear your Blue or White all week to support your team and bring your strongest cheering voice. 

DRINKING IS NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUB CRAWL / PARADE
(The Nut House has great nachos!)

ON TUESDAY: Join us for the Unofficial Game Day Pub Crawl
We'll depart from the Facebook office's at 5:30 PM sharp in the first ever Facebook parade down California Avenue ending up at Antonio's Nut House. ← Note: This is going to be epic if everyone shows up and we march all dressed in white and blue!

If you are in 1601:
Meet in the upper parking lot (try not to block the round-about for the shuttles). 

If you are in 1050:
Walk over to the parking lot near California Avenue and the 1601 folks will pick you up along the way.

There will be a series of informal Blue v White contests en route and at the bar. For the die-hards we'll take this battle all the way down to DTPA at the Old Pro and beyond.

Plan on getting on CalTrain either at 7:57 and heading over to the Old Pro - we'll move to Nola's from there to close out a very very good night.

          With these hard economic times, we know that you ain't goin' nowhere for Memorial Day. Kick off your staycation (we hate that word, too) with the Vintage Music Collective at Mojito Sf on Friday, May 28th! 
For the recession-proof price of just $5 (Five Dollars, U.S. Currency) you get 3 full sets of danceable roots-reggae from a 12-piece band.

Vintage Music Collective is 12 people making music together.  Harmonious singers, hittin' horns, and groovin' rhythm.  VMC is based out of East Palo Alto, CA and plays every 4th Friday at Mojito in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood.  Live music from 9:30 PM until 1:30 AM featuring danceable original tunes plus songs you know by Third World, Lucky Dube, Bob Marley &amp; many others.

21 and over w/ID!
