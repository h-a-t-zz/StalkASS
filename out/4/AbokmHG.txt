          The second official "8 Spot" Production is once again being hosted by James and Alvin. We also have a new addition because the "cool" neighbor, Matt, will be co-hosting as he opens his doors to the masses next door. 

Feel free to come wearing red and black since Valentine's Day is right around the corner. Speaking of valentines, if you roll without one you'll probably leave with one...or two. Or, if you roll with your valentine I can't think of a more romantic setting than 825 University Ave.

The drinks will be flowin and the music will be bumpin. Although, if you drink like a fish please feel free to bring your own alcohol. 

The plan is to host everybody until around 11:30pm at which time we will roll to Blue Chalk in downtown P.A. because the structure of our building isn't very strong.

Yes, there will be an unofficial after party at the 8 spot afterwards.

P.S. Please don't turn the heater up to 100 degrees this time...you don't pay the bill

P.S.S. We aren't a fan of guests walking on the walls like last time either

P.S.S.S. No holes shall be punched into the door this time...one is enough...i wont mention any names

P.S.S.S.S. The panty dropper drink is a request only drink...if you can't hold your liquor then don't request it...and no you can't know the ingredients

P.P.P.P.P.S. Apparently I don't know how to write P.S. because it's P.P.S. (post post script) not P.S.S. (post script script)

          We know how stressful it can get around this time of year:  No parking at the mall, gotta kick it with those relatives that you don't really get along with, Starbucks runs out of eggnog for your latte... All the typical holiday madness can really get you down.

Fear not, friends.  

Come blow off some steam with the Vintage Music Collective at Mojito in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood.  The VMC is a 12-piece roots-reggae &amp; soul-music group based out of East Palo Alto, CA.  VMC will be serving up danceable world-rhythms, tight vocal harmonies, and instrumental solos from some of the best musicians that the peninsula has to offer.  VMC offers a serious commitment to your well-being this holiday season.

Mojito is a neighborhood restaurant and bar located on Grant St. in the heart of North Beach serving up homestyle Latin cuisine and live music seven nights a week. The atmosphere is causal, and the fun loving staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.  Come early and grub on some tacos or other tapas.  Mojito offers a full bar, and to no one's surprise, serves up some mean Mojitos.

If you've enjoyed the company of the Vintage Music Collective, we encourage you to come party with us, and bring some friends who don't know what it's all about.  We love meeting new faces and making new friends.  Come get down with the Vintage Music Collective!

Music will be live from 9:30 PM until 1:30 AM.  You need to be 21 or over w/ID to get in.  $10 at the door.
Mojito is at 1337 Grant Ave. (between Vallejo &amp; Green) in San Francisco.

Due to popular demand we are having our third official 8 Spot Party, commemorating the great decade that was the 90's. This time we have visitors though...

Kevin Gao (Kgao) is traveling 2,937 miles to attend
Michael Shotton is traveling 476 miles to attend
Logan Ford is traveling 2,848 miles to attend
Andy Moon is traveling 2,936 miles to attend

The festivities begin at 9:00 pm. Bring your friends and some alcohol because we will probably run out sooner rather than later. This party features two apartments and our garages...quite luxurious if you ask me. There will be 90's music playing all night on a pristine dance floor (my living room) and beer pong in the garages.

The normal rules apply...the drinks will be flowing and stories shall be told about this epic party.

P.S. 90's attire is required for entry
P.P.S. Fight fans come early - UFC 69 @ 7pm on a massive DLP projector

P.P.P.S. - You see those two fuck ups in that picture on the right?  Well one is a stock broker and one is gonna be a doctor.  I just thought I should let y'all know they arent fuck ups anymore.
-Shotty the Body

P.P.P.P.S. Kevin motherfuckin Gao decided that our party was more important than his job at McKenzie in NYC...all four presidents will be in attendance

* Cookout at our house in the late afternoon
* Party in the evening
* Perhaps a group field trip to new an exciting bars in the peninsula (or, you know, whatever, we'll wing it)

Emerald Hills is in Redwood City -- it's a quick trip from 280.
