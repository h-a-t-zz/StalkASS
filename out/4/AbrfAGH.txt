          BBQ at our new apartment! Come by for some burgers and beer in our backyard. We will probably head to the Nuthouse around 10 to continue the festivities. 

Please feel free to bring others we might have missed on the invite list.

           I thought it would be fun to try something new. I found this place in SF where you dine in the dark.

I hear it makes for interesting conversation and food tastes better(I shouldn't be in sales)

RSVP yes or no so I can make reservations. Its $99 a person which is pretty steep so start saving some bucks now.

*reservations are at 6:30 and I will add more people if needed

Please add yourself to the event if I missed you!! The more the better even though you won't even know who is there :)

          We rented an RV and would like anyone to join us, even if it's just for the drive down, for totally kick ass 2 day festival that is Coachella. We plan on leaving Friday April 28th and driving back up Sunday May 1st. ;

If I forgot anyone in the guest list, I appologize, just let me know and I'll add them. ;

 Did I mention that Sigur Rós and Massive Attack are going to be there?

          It's been a few months since we fled the Windy's zone and grabbed some non-watered-down Chinese food. And this time we can go to a larger restaurant (but still one with great food) that's more likely to be able to seat us all at once.
