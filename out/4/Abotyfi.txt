Meet Chris Kelly

Chris is running for California Attorney General to bring his longstanding public policy, legal and business experience to the critical role of the State's chief law enforcement and consumer protection officer. As Attorney General, Chris's experience creating jobs and a safer and more trusted online experience would inform his return to his roots in public service as an aide to President Clinton.

Chris currently serves as Chief Privacy Officer of Facebook, overseeing privacy, security, and safety for the site's 200 million users. While at Facebook, working side by side with Attorneys General from across the nation, Chris has developed and implemented technology features to protect young people and allow all users to have a safer and more trusted online experience. Chris has also been a champion of Facebook's capability to connect people to their elected officials across the globe.

Prior to joining Facebook, Chris returned to his boyhood home of Silicon Valley to practice law. Through his work in private practice, Chris advised some of the most innovative Internet and media clients on the increasing challenges of intellectual property and privacy protection for the digital age. He represented clients at the cutting edge of legal issues from online safety and privacy to antitrust that are central to the Attorney General's law enforcement and consumer protection roles.

After graduating from law school, Chris clerked for federal Judge Barry Moskowitz, of the United States District Court in San Diego. As a clerk, Chris assisted Judge Moskowitz on various criminal and civil cases involving drug smuggling, immigration and money laundering.

During his time with the Clinton Administration, Chris gained an abiding respect for public service and greater desire to be a public servant. As a policy advisor for President Clinton's White House Domestic Policy Council and Department of Education, Chris worked on important domestic programs including the successful initiative to put 100,000 new community police officers on America's streets and the formation of AmeriCorps, a network of national service programs that engage Americans in community service for education, public safety, health and the environment.

A longtime California resident with experience in the public, legal and business sectors, Chris has a unique grasp on the issues facing Californians. After growing up in Santa Ana and San Jose, Chris received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 1991, a master's degree from Yale University in 1992, and his law degree from Harvard University in 1997.

Chris currently serves on the Board of Directors for the San Francisco 49ers Academy, a public middle school in East Palo Alto. Chris resides in Palo Alto with his wife Jennifer, an entrepreneur and former prosecutor, and their son Aidan.
