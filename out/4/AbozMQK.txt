Makers Club is for anyone who makes things professionally. Designers, artists, architects, photographers, illustrators, typographers, filmmakers, writers, programmers, printers, copywriters, carpenters, etcetera are all welcome. There is no agenda, it's not for recruiting, the point is just to meet, talk, and drink with other interesting people. Simple.

Did you know that four billion people worldwide live on less than $3 a day and have no access to formal work?

At Samasource, we believe that access to dignified work is a fundamental human right and a necessity in order to fight poverty at its roots.

Come join us as we strive to raise $1 million to give life-changing work to women and youth globally and announce our US pilot, SamaUSA. 

It's going to be an incredible gathering of 400 high-profile Bay Area influencers and Samasource supporters, and we would love to have you there.
