           Join us at Heron Arts for our inaugural open studio showcase, presenting new completed works from a group of artists working across mediums — including paint, metal, blown glass, and digital light projection.

The show focuses on the interplay between artistic personalities and forms. All the artists have collaborated on a single, large-scale piece that incorporates all mediums. Each artist will also present an individual work in their own medium, relating that component to the whole.

         House-Heads pres. Bay of Wigs 2: Another Wig Party on a Boat

           ******** Boarding + Ticket Info ********

We will start boarding the boat at Pier 40 promptly at 11:30AM and the boat will sail the sea from noon until 4pm. We'll have a Saigon vietnamese sandwich waiting for you which was included in your ticket price, and alcohol will be available for purchase onboard, cash only.

Sadly, we've sold out all our tickets. However, last year there were a few last-minute no-shows, and this will probably happen again, so we'll have a first-come first-served waitlist at the pier. If you don't have a ticket, I suggest arriving some time before 11:30am to have one of our doorwigs add your name to the waitlist (1 waitlist spot per a person, please).

If you DO have a ticket and haven't made it to Pier 40 by 11:50AM, we will assume that you are forfeiting your ticket for one of the waitlisters.

I'm looking forward to seeing all your wigs and crazy getups. Last year's party was a classic...everyone looked ridiculous and I've never seen such a colorful collection of people on the water before. Let's do it again!!

          ************



On Saturday, August 11th, the House-Heads (Atish, Roddy, and Slee) will once again take to the Hi-Cs, smearing beats across the bay like Slimer, dropping grooves so funky they'll squash the speakers like boxes of Ecto Cooler.

Lest we have to explain, this isn't a normal boat party. This is a wig party. A wig party on a boat. So don some haute couture headgear and wrap up your noggin in the most fabulous, flamboyant fashion you can find. This boat simply can't be boarded without appropriate cranial decoration.

Beats lovingly provided by your House-Heads residents, Atish, Mark Slee, and Roddy "The Ride" Lindsay.

Exact details on boarding and departure will be provided in due course - the ship will sail the Bay for an all-afternoon affair from one of the San Francisco Piers. First things first, reserve your space. Buy the ticket, take the ride - gliding across the glittering waves, sparkling under the sunshine. This party *will* sell out, so don't sleep on it.
