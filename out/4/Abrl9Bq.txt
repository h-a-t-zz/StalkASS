          IBM and the NVCA have invited me to give a talk on corporate venture capital at the annual NVCA conference. I am humbled to be asked to speak at the venture industry's premier event. Good thing is Georges Doriot's story has a lot of lessons to offer the folks who practive corporate VC.

I am taking part in a half-day session "designed for collaborative discussion between traditional VCs and their corporate counterparts. The agenda includes topics on how corporate venture capital DNA evolves to breed success, and the importance of building strong strategic alliances in today’s global marketplace."

          D is the fourth letter of the alphabet. It enables awesome words such as:

1) Desserts - yum!
2) Drinks - to be drunk
3) December - kicking off the month right
4) Delicious - which will be at this event
5) Dimsum - which will not be at this event

(So non-D letters don't feel left out, here are some other excellent terms:)

Cupcake - what I'll be making (with Sprinkles mix.) Also the name of my cat. Cat-allergic people beware!
You - bring yourself, maybe a friend, maybe a drink or dessert to sweeten the deal

          Since apparently sitting alone in my pajamas watching Netflix and eating ice cream out of a carton is 'pathetic'...

Help celebrate my birthday by coming to the Old Pro on Sunday.  Watch a football game, hang out, and drink a beer with me.

Nothing sounds worse than hearing people quote Borat before I get to see the movie. So, opening night it is. 

Feel free to bring your fake moustache &amp; accents...hopefully i remembered to bring mine from seattle. Seriously.
