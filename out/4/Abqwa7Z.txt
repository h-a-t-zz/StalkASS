         Inappropriately Tight t-shirt Bday Extravaganza

          I know my B-day party is something people wait for all year. I know I do!  That is why I Paris Hilton’d the shit out of my invite; made an invite a few days ago, canceled it, freaked people out, made them feel unworthy and confused.  Now I am re-posting and you have no idea if I might cancel again minutes before the party, or change locations seconds before you arrive.  Sooooo inappropriate.

Everyone knows I don’t throw a party without a theme, so the official theme is Inappropriately Tight t-shirt.  This can be expanded to inappropriate outfit/overall look/attitude.
I want to see chest hair, muffin tops, spray tans, neon, tight tank tops, t-shirts, unitards, acrylic nails, hoop earrings, etc.  I want to see people take the inappropriate to another level and then regret it the next day.

The good news about this theme is we are close to the Marina so you will fit right in.
The bad news is Tonic is right next to a gym so people will be judging the shit out of you.

We have all the tables at Tonic reserved for the party.  So get there early to ensure entry.  First person to get kicked out of the bar wins a prize.


If I left someone out, and you are confident I didn’t do it on purpose, then feel free to forward the event to others.  People who are not on facebook are not invited.  That’s just insulting and frankly completely inappropriate.

(my eyes kind of started to blur and may have skipped a few letters while inviting people...my B)
