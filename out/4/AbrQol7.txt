          Damn gurls! We are SOLD OUT!
There is a possibility that people who purchased tickets will not show up at the event, so you may still have a chance to board the boat...Sit tight for more details if you don't have a ticket....


Dearest friends, the time has surely come for us to sail the high seas together. Join us on a seafaring adventure of magical beats and mystery, as we embark upon the San Francisco Bay on the 13th of August, the year of our maiden voyage, 2011.

But an ordinary watered-down experience would surely be far too tame for the likes of ye mateys, so an additional stipulation has been thoughtfully applied. This, fine compatriots, is a seafaring Wig Party, and we most graciously demand that when you grace this fine vessel with your presence, may your head be graced with a Wig of the silly, sexy, funky, or beautiful variety - whatever floats your boat. Try to surprise us!

Boarding will begin at 12:30 for a prompt departure at 1:00pm, you mustn't be late! Boarding is at 89 King St, just next to AT&amp;T park.

Your house-heads residents, Atish, Mark Slee, and The Ride will be serving up salacious, sundry beats of the sunny variety all afternoon long.



This event is significantly more expensive to put together than our previous ROMPS, and we want to keep ticket prices reasonable and accessible to as many friends as possible. For those who have the means to spend a little more, we've enabled a VIP ticket option which is essentially a $20 donation which will help us meet our costs. A VIP ticket will include a small token gift to represent our appreciation for your help.

Makers Club is for anyone who makes things professionally. Designers, artists, architects, photographers, illustrators, typographers, filmmakers, writers, programmers, printers, copywriters, carpenters, etcetera are all welcome. There is no agenda, it's not for recruiting, the point is just to meet, talk, and drink with other interesting people. Simple.
