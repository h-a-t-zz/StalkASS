          Some of you may have already heard the bad news that this year's LovEvolution daytime parade has been canceled. Tragic as this may be, we saw no reason to let it sidetrack another of our favorite traditions... the We ♥ Breakfast techno brunch at 1023!

Join us Saturday morning for mimosas, fruits, baked breakfast goods, eggies, whatever else we make, and of course Naomi's famous breakfast pizzas. The House-Heads DJs (Atish, Roddy, Slee) will bring the beats.

Feel free to bring a little ditty to share if you're so inclined, but absolutely no obligation. Friends are welcome too, please just give us a heads up or have them RSVP on the event so we can get a good estimate for the food situation.

          Though her chubby cheeks and sweet demeanor may have fooled you, the hard fact is that Anne Strand, a.k.a. “Miss Annie," is turning the big 3-0 this year. She has the white hairs to prove it! Oops, I wasn’t supposed to say that. To celebrate her long and illustrious life, please join us at Rosewood in North Beach ready to toast the Pint-Size Phenom (during the golden years of her youth, Anne partied like it was 1999 – well, it probably was, but that’s besides the point – and rode her bike across the entire United States). All jokes aside, my sister and I would love to see you for a few drinks and a whole lot of reassuring stories that life doesn’t truly begin until your 30s. Hope you can make it!

          don't let the tagline fool you, this is going to be a classy party. ratty ratowitz wouldn't have it any other way.

paul's birthday was 2 days ago, so it only seems appropriate to have his birthday party 7 days from now. this means you have a week to come up with the rattiest stories, proper ratty* attire, and drinks. as always, the night will end with a 3am dance party, so bring your ratty dance moves as well.

if you don't get the whole 'ratty' thing, its ok. neither do i. just go with it. 

happy birthday paul!

*ratty attire doesn't only have to include dressing like a rat (the animal). you can dress up as the rat pack, cheese (doubles as a wisco treat and rat food), paul on an especially ratty day, etc. bonus shots will be awarded to the best outfit. extra bonus points if you rock the rattail. 

in the spirit of being a rat, i'm sure i forgot to invite people (and i'm not friends with everyone) so feel free to bring peeps:)
