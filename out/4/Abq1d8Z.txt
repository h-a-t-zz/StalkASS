Makers Club is for anyone who makes things professionally. Designers, artists, architects, photographers, illustrators, typographers, filmmakers, writers, programmers, printers, copywriters, carpenters, etcetera are all welcome. There is no agenda, it's not for recruiting, the point is just to meet, talk, and drink with other interesting people. Simple.

          If you have been looking for an excuse to check out The Possible at the Berkeley Art Museum, tomorrow is a good opportunity.  Weather depending, Sarah's class will either be on Fritz Haeg's rug in the museum around 1:00 or out in the courtyard maybe more around 2:00.  Or maybe both.  Anything is possible.  Bring a mat if you have one but its not required.   And if you're not in a yoga mood, the outdoor showers will be open encouraging physical engagement of any sort, so come hike Strawberry Canyon or Tilden in the Berkeley Hills, take a run through campus, play weird made up games in the courtyard, or just enjoy all the performances, workshops, and exhibits going on tomorrow all as parts of The Possible.  Museum is open 11-5.
