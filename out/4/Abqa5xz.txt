July 14: T becomes an old person
July 15: Jeff's Bday (still a young person)
July 17: Mon's Bday (also still a young person)

come have a drink or 2 (hundred) with us on saturday night! i'm not sure exactly where the night will take us, but we'll probably start off at the old pro (you may have heard of it:) ) 

we'll probably hop around to other places, so call one of us if we can't be found. (or just look for my new shiny walker)

          Dave turned 27 a few weeks ago, and now it is time to celebrate!  Join us for drinks and a night of drunken mayhem in San Francisco.  We'll start at Dave, James, and Jon's apartment and then proceed out to Dave's favorite bars in the Mission District to see if Dave can still drink like he is 21!

          Fucking Julie beat me by one day.

I got my new place all set up (only took me two months), and so now it's time to celebrate. There will be plenty of alcohol on hand. Also really good music. I've been making the playlist my whole life.

So if you live in PA, remember that it's Saturday night and it's just a Caltrain ride away. You can take Caltrain to Milbrae, then BART to 24th street and it's a 5 minute walk from there. You can probably crash on my floor too.

People in SF - it's right near 26th and Valencia.

Ring the bell at 3603 or call my cell when you're here.

Yes, 30. NBD. Come celebrate my passage into this wonderful era. Also I'm sure I'm forgetting to invite some people so if you know someone I should have invited let me know.
