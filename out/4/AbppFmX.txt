Things like:

The war elephant corps of the Southern Han being soundly defeated at Shao by crossbow fire from Song Dynasty troops.

The death of Elva Zona Heaster in Greenbrier County, West Virginia that resulted in the only US court case where the testimony of a ghost helped secure a conviction.

The sale of a flying disc to the Wham-O toy company, later renamed to the "Frisbee".

The birth of David Braginsky, me.

So come by and celebrate everything that makes life wonderful (hint: it's you).

I will have snacks, but feel free (and not obligated) to bring more things to share.

(If I missed you in the invites, you are extra-invited)

Makers Club is for anyone who makes things professionally. Designers, artists, architects, photographers, illustrators, typographers, filmmakers, writers, programmers, printers, copywriters, carpenters, etcetera are all welcome. There is no agenda, it's not for recruiting, the point is just to meet, talk, and drink with other interesting people. Simple.

          Not really a housewarming since our place is warm enough already. More like christening the place with a few drinks and some bumpin' beats. Kind of like smashing the wine bottle against a boat, you know?

We'll provide the grog and the beats, you will provide winning attitudes, smiles, and more grog (if you think it fit).
