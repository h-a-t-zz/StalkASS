          www.justyo.co/ Yo is sponsoring this, it's one of my favorite new apps of the year. Why? It shows you when your context has changed (it Yo's me, for instance, when it'll rain in next hour, or when stock market goes up or down by more than 100).

           Git is widely adopted in the e-org and there have been many success stories of increased productivity (e.g. multitasking with local branches/
          
          
          
          
          
          
           checkpoints, debugging with git-bisect, etc.) from everyone who's tried it.  

The Facebook GIT challenge is as follows: 

1) Install Git, and for a FULL 2 1/2 WEEKS, use it for the MAJORITY of your checkins into the PHP codebase.  

2) After your 2 1/2 weeks are up, write  on the wall of this event with your testimonial on whether (or not) your productivity has significantly increased because of GIT. 

 At the end of February, all participants who manage to go a FULL  2 1/2 weeks on GIT will be taken out to a free lunch by the Git mailing list community.

FOR EXISTING GIT USERS - The "PLUS" Challenge

For users who already enjoy the benefits of GIT, there's some "plus" challenges that you can attempt:
e.g.
- use git bisect during a push for debugging, etc.
- pipe git diff to diffcamp, or use diffcamp -gs
- merge an svn branch using git
(please feel free to add your "plus" challenge to the wall)

          Think your belly was going to get a break after the holidays? Think again. This time let's crank up the culinary thermostat with some tasty Sichuan food from a restaurant that's not afraid to make it as hot as it ought to be. (But they also do good mild stuff for all the non-spice-hounds among us.)

          Tomorrow I turn 31 and have decided to celebrate like i'm 11! Come bowl, drink beer, and enjoy some general debauchery like we used to back in 5th grade! I've reserved 4 lanes but will expand if needed. Please feel free to bring whoever as long as they bring a night of mayhem like attitude. This also means you should feel free to dress up in some ridiculous fashion. Finally, this was a last minute decision which is why you're getting this invite today but I can't imagine you have better Monday night plans.

OK, onto the rules. 

1. There are three prizes for the 3 top scores - A coozy made of beads you can hang around your neck, a shark water gun, and a squeezable alien thing. Top score gets first choice, second best score gets second choice, and so on.

2. Highest score will have to wear a Sweet 16 Sash so everyone knows how sweet they are. When someone gets a higher score they will relinquish that sash and finish their drink.

3. Lowest score will wear the Yellow Boa of Swallowing Sadness. If someone then gets a lower score they will have to don the Boa and finish their drink.

4. If you get 2 gutter balls in a row you have to perform some ridiculous old school dance - kid n’ play, running man, etc.

5. For every strike you get you can make someone take a drink.

6. If you get a turkey you have to bowl the next frame with your non-dominant hand.

7. If you get two spares in two consecutive frames you get to choose someone to have to bowl their next shot with their non-dominant hand.

8. If you bowl two prime numbers in a row you have to bowl backwards on your next shot.

Please leave additional rules in the comments and we'll add them to the official rule set. See y'all tomorrow!

          Join me for MORE of my big Palo Alto farewell party before I depart for Dublin. We're going to start the night off with some bowling at the historic Palo Alto Bowl (this could also count as a farewell to it). Later, we'll move down to Blue Chalk, OP, and/or Rudy's for the adventurous. 

For you city dwellers: I'm still trying to pick a place for a suitable farewell party up there. Stay tuned.
