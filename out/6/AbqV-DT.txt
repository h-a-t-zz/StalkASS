          So excited to announce the 2nd annual Burning Man Tutu Tuesday!  The concept of Tutu Tuesday originated on the playa and it is such a joy to pay our homage with a stellar lineup and, of course, lots and lots of tutus.

This year, we welcome back Philipp from M.A.N.D.Y. who played an epic sun-set last year.  Sandwiched around him with tender tutu love will be Dejan from Cityfox and my personal favorite, Mightykat!

Opening the show at tutu o clock with a dreamy extended playtime are House-head brothers Slee and Atish.  They have both put a lot of effort into making this a beautiful experience for everyone so come early, stay late, and DON'T FORGET your tutu.

THIS is how you start your burn week with style.
