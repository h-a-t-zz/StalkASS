Hello friends!

Team Boba's Fettish ...
          
         
        
        
         
          
           Thursday, February 28, 2013, 7 PM - 10 PM in PST

         ANEURYSM &amp; AVM MIRACLE 5K

           The Delta Kappa chapter of Alpha Phi Omega will be hosting the Aneurysm and AVM Miracle 5K on Saturday, April 18th in honor of Gilad Nissim, a close family friend of a Delta Kappa brother, Hilary. Hilary met Gilad Nissim (1993-2013) when she was two years old. He was her brother’s best friend, and became an older brother figure to her. When Gilad was a freshman at Towson University, he was on his way to class when a blood vessel in his brain burst due to AVM. He remained in a coma for 8 months, until he passed away on November 17th 2013 at the age of 19. Gilad was incredibly friendly and outgoing, making himself known wherever he goes. Hilary organized this race in order to keep Gilad’s spirit alive. 

The 5K will begin at 9:00 am. It will start at the WrecRoom in Woodruff Residential Center (1495 Clifton Road), wind through Lullwater Park, and end in front of Woodruff. We will be giving prizes to the top three male and female finishers. Enjoy the spring weather by going for a run with your friends, and benefit a charity while you are at it! 
 
Please wear red or burgundy, the color associated with Aneurysm and AVM awareness, as well as Gilad's favorite color (because of Iron Man). 
 
All proceeds will be given to The Aneurysm and AVM Foundation (TAAF). TAAF is a nonprofit organization which funds research for and raises awareness of aneurysms and other vascular malformations, as well as supports the patients and families of patients with these conditions.

Last Thursdays is a monthly showcase of new work by visual, musical &amp; culinary artists who inspire &amp; expand our community. On February 26th we present the paintings of Heather Day &amp; the music of Insightful from Soulection. We'll have an open bar provided by Muffin Street Brewery, delicious culinary cuisine provided by Thistle, and further soundtracking from Popstack for your enjoyment.

Heather Day's paintings explore color and texture in a narrative way. Every mark creates a series of expectations similar to a conversation. When a question is asked, an answer is anticipated. These paintings are never planned. Each painting is a product of an experience, leaving behind documentation of how an event transpired.

·٠•● ELECTRONIC AWAKENING FILM SCREENING @ 7PM ●•٠·

ELECTRONIC AWAKENING is an ethnographic documentary film which investigates the spirituality and mysticism of Electronic Dance Music Culture (EDMC).

In Electronic Awakening, director Andrew Johner lifts the veil on an underground spiritual movement that has developed within electronic music cultures worldwide. This close encounter with the mysticism of rave questions the origin of religion, and offers insight into future of man’s spirituality. It investigates this culture’s significance to the prophecies of 2012, how this bizarre and sacral relationship to electronic music has evolved the group over time, and where it all seems to be leading them...
