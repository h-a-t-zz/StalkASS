           This week at Sub Cinema Sunday:

John Cassavetes's "A Woman Under the Influence."

Representin' the Godfather of American Independent Filmmaking.

If you haven't seen a Cassavetes before, expect a storytelling experience so raw and realistic you won't believe how believable it is. No glossy Hollywood bullshit here; Cassavetes smiled big and character-acted in blockbusters like The Dirty Dozen just to fund his true passions. This auteur elicits immersive performances within intense scenarios like few others can. 

Vegetables will be served. 

RAW.

Starring Peter Falk (television's famous Lieutenant Columbo, as well as an ingenious turn as "himself" in Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire) and Gina Rowlands (Cassavetes's wife and ten-time collaborator).

a couple scenes if you're interested:

Yes, 30. NBD. Come celebrate my passage into this wonderful era. Also I'm sure I'm forgetting to invite some people so if you know someone I should have invited let me know.

          **Apologies for using the same invite from 2 years ago! Same place, new year. Come visit!

Come visit the Bay Area's finest local artists on the first weekend of November. Literally hundreds of artists, ranging from painters to sculptors to photographers, invite you into their studios to see their works raw at the source. 

My Mom, Elizabeth Tana, will be showing her work in Building 101, Studio 2204. Her work is awesome (see pics). Swing by and say hi!

If you're not convinced, here are the top 10 reasons to come. 

#10) Build street cred by visiting HP (Hunter's Point) 
#9) Discover the next Diebenkorn, Oliviera, or Thiebaud
#8) Take a break from World Series awesomeness
#7) Buy that little (or big) something to really 'tie the room' together
#6) Pretend like you support the arts
#5) Take in the rarely seen views of 'the Point'
#4) "Invest" in a 10K painting
#3) Rub shoulders with quirky, awkward artist types
#2) Do something different this weekend
#1) Because art is what poetry can't describe

          I whipped up some chili for tomorrow - should be good to go around 3.  Come on time to feed, casually late to play beirut.  

Casual diners fear not: I would be remiss if I didn't craft some chili nachos at some point.  Beer haters: yes, there will be a bar.

Feel free to invite whoevers - I am lazy.
