          Friends, I'm on my way to London.

I've finally applied for a visa. I've started packing up my things. I've even traded my car for a summer's worth of booze. 

Please come share some with me.

Not coincidentally this happens to be the first official night of pride. Please show up for a pre-party party. 

Look forward to the chance to say goodbye.

          Since apparently sitting alone in my pajamas watching Netflix and eating ice cream out of a carton is 'pathetic'...

Help celebrate my birthday by coming to the Old Pro on Sunday.  Watch a football game, hang out, and drink a beer with me.

Nothing sounds worse than hearing people quote Borat before I get to see the movie. So, opening night it is. 

Feel free to bring your fake moustache &amp; accents...hopefully i remembered to bring mine from seattle. Seriously.
