           Uprisings for Genuine Change (In solidarity with the people of Egypt and Burma)

Join us for a roundtable conversation with some of the leaders of Burma’s 1988 student-led uprising and 2007 monk-led protests as we compare and discuss the current uprising in Egypt.

Tentative agenda:
1) Discuss chronological history of current unfolding uprising in Egypt 
2) Student leaders from 1988 uprising share their experiences 
3) Monk leaders from 2007 Saffron protests share their experiences 
4) Discuss social media roles and their significant contributions toward change
5) Compare and contrast between Egypt and Burma uprisings 
6) How do we move forward in Burma?

You won't be opted into anything, you won't get any extra emails, heck your name won't even be shown.  

You will just be helping a hardworking mama realize her dream of having her small business featured in Martha Stewart Magazine along with $10,000 to take my business Baby Jives Co to the next level.  And I get to meet Martha!

I am in the running for the Martha Stewart American Made Awards with my company Baby Jives Co.  I created the company making heirloom quality mobiles, 2 years ago when my son finally started sleeping through the night.  I work from home while my kids sleep and when my mom can take them for a bit and it would mean the world to me if you would take a moment and cast a vote for me.  Thank you!

YOU CAN VOTE ONCE PER DAY NOW until 9/24. 
Voting is open worldwide
