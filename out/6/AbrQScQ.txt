          They say good things come to those who wait so we held off on this booking for the off-chance that the ever fabulous Philipp Jung would extend his west coast visit to play this Tutu Tuesday--and we won!

It is not easy to pin down this globetrotting DJ demigod but he is feeling the Burning Man vibes and we are about to Get extremely Physical at Harlot this month.

What can I say? You are welcome, people. I am SO damn excited!

Love,

There is an air of mystery shrouding the true meaning behind the acronym of M.A.N.D.Y., an alias which embodies the mutual talents of childhood friends Philipp Jung and Patrick Bodmer. The pair readily indulge this curiosity by toying with various clever possibilities, including Me AND You, but the truth is likely a giggle under each of their talented breaths. P and P have carved a unique niche in electronic music by consistently selecting productions that induce their audience into a somatic frenzy. On the platform of their aptly titled Get Physical label, M.A.N.D.Y. has achieved massive success in colluding to create music that simply makes bodies move. Their foot stamping, hair flying passion is the ultimate expression of a dance music phenomenon for many years.

When M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade joined as musical soul mates with DJ T., first in Frankfurt, then in Berlin, Get Physical produced a caliber of electricity that rippled throughout the EDM community and into the relative mainstream. Philipp's charm and savvy, Patrick's allusive artistry, DJ T.'s killer entrepreneurial sense and Booka Shade's collaborative genius combined to form a masterpiece of intelligent design that reflects romantic sensibility and technical virtuosity. Together, they push the boundaries of dance music to compile an enviable arsenal of electro kissing house while caressing disco and flirting with techno. Body Language was the ubiquitous hit of 2005 and M.A.N.D.Y.'s Fabric Series three years later cemented their reputation as two of the most captivating selectors on the planet. One of their most recent prestige was a complication for Renaissance in 2009 which was met with tremendous accolades and described by Resident Advisor as "maturity, smarts, and cohesion...that is rare these days."

Philipp and Patrick know exactly which buttons to press to make that bass jiggle up your spine and seduce your body free. Alongside many lives compadres Booka Shade, M.A.N.D.Y. has taken some time from their hectic global tour schedule to devise new elaborations, culminating in the release of Body Language Vol. 10 in April 2011. In addition to a single release that will be the first Booka Shade vs. M.A.N.D.Y. cooperation to be heard in years, the boys have closed on a revolutionary touring show that utilizes infrared technology and a new mapping technique to project inverted video effects onto their Physical form as they perform. It is no doubt that their plans for this never before seen live visual component will conjure the kind of visceral excitement that only this duo can. In the feat of the imagination, M.A.N.D.Y. powers on through a perpetual rebirth into pulsating beats and pretty lights.

Propeller Saturday April 12th, welcomes back a real one off in the electronic music scene, a character thatâ€™s uniquely held high in the echelons of the San Francisco club scene. A DJ whose name conjures up affection from clubbers and industry alike; Lee Burridge.

Famed for his marathon sets, then the marathon set at the afterparty, always bringing fans and new friends with him from one party to the next, never playing that last tune whilst thereâ€™s still people standingâ€¦ Itâ€™s easy to see why heâ€™s so loved.

A DJ who effortlessly joins the dots between tech house, techno, deep house and beyond - but always consistently held together with that signature hypnotic groove that heâ€™s so well known for. Whether itâ€™s in dust at Burning Man on the Robot Heart or in room 1 fabric playing with Craig Richards as part of Tyrant, the man never disappointsâ€¦

Enjoy the San Francisco Symphony with Edwin Outwater, Director of Summer Concerts, and Bryce Dessner of The National, at a free outdoor concert in the grassy plaza at Pier 27, located on the Embarcadero at the foot of Lombard Street. Come soak up the sun (fingers crossed) and enjoy the sounds of the summer. Bring a blanket and your favorite foods and drinks.

The Symphonix, the SF Symphonyâ€™s premier group for young professionals in the Bay Area, will be holding a "meet-up" during the concert, hosted by board members Kris Kolassa and Cate McDonough. Look for balloons and signage. https://
