As many of you have started to tweet and talk about, she is cast on the Bravo reality TV show and is documenting her life, part of it as an angel investor in Shaker.

Come enjoy live music by FAR EAST MOVEMENT and more..
There's hors d’oeuvres and a hosted bar till 10pm...and, of course, the best company in town.

And did we mention there will be surprises? 
Well...there will be surprises.

We perfer the party to stay private and by invite only, hence we decided to keep the Bravo cameras out this time but happy to have Sarah and friends with us.

The Four Seasons, Palo Alto
Ballroom 
Hors d'oeuvres and Drinks 
Dress: formal business attire meets hollywood

On behalf of Sarah Austin and the Pop17 team, I would like to invite you to Pop17's "Bubble Tank" this coming Thursday, July 5th, from 3pm to 6pm at the Four Seasons Silicon Valley. The “Bubble Tank” event is aimed to connect founders to venture capitalists and is going to be filmed by a major TV network. The format will follow that of ABC's "Shark Tank", where CEOs and founders pitch their companies to investors. The event will be a great way to connect and is an opportunity to be seen by millions of viewers. It's $15 online and $20 at the door.
