“Wallflowers … those shy ones! Oh! Cling! Cling thee to the furthermost borders—the hinterlands. Sublimate, oh, sublimate thy libidinal impulses into decorative organic motifs … ornamental hair growths, aesthetically placed tattoos. Beauty-mark thyself! … Oh! Oh! Oh!”

– Mike Kelley

Wallflowers stand on the edges, serving as an emotional receptacle for the lives of others. Their ability to slow things down and analyze situations beyond the surface is often dismissed as anti-social behavior. This keen ability to see the underlying tension within an encounter is an acute skill that should not be ignored. Wallflowers are also quirky, unique individuals with their own personal aesthetic. They try to hide, but stand out because they are different. Wearing a camouflage of sorts, they blend into their environment to avoid being noticed, introverting so they can eavesdrop on the conversation from afar. If these walls––if these wallflowers––could only talk.

When an artist makes a piece of art, it is essentially a way of voicing an opinion that cannot necessarily be expressed through words. The work stands in for the artist and serves as a representation of an experience that is personal––but, because art is an arbitrary field this experience gets abstracted and evolves into new interpretations via the viewer. The work enters an area that is beyond its concept or objecthood, as it becomes a part of a larger conversation within issues of feminism, escapism, anxiety, failure, fantasy, community, and stereotypes. The viewer carries this conversation with them out into society to share with others––the dialogue trickles down to expand beyond the art world.

The Workshop will fill up!

The next round of cuddling is in our midst! I'm constantly inspired to permeate San Francisco culture with more intimacy and trust, and these nights are what keep this fire fueled! I'm so very grateful to continue growing this community around inclusivity, intimacy, safety, and touch. 

So come on down! Whether you bring a friend, partner, family member, or just yourself, feel free to stop in to deepen your connection to affection, other people, intimacy, and, ultimately, yourself. This workshop and party are meant to empower you to be the intimacy creator that you are all on your own, and to remember the value of your own way of connecting. Here's a little info on each part of the evening:

**WORKSHOP**

~ GOALS: My goal is to help you walk away with more comfort in talking about/receiving/
          
          
          
          
          
          
           giving intimacy and to be able to voice your needs, desires, and boundaries more confidently and comfortably

~ A safe, warm, loving space to slow down, relax, and explore intimacy, affection, and touch with friends and strangers

~ A foundational set of simple, easy rules to help keep everyone on the same page and able to trust one another (and themselves) more deeply

~ A short introduction to the philosophy behind Cuddle Therapy and why these workshops were started

~ Activities to reconnect to the self and each other to help shed light and feel more at ease about the pressure around intimacy and touch that exists within each of us

~ An opportunity to ask the questions and start the conversations you may normally be too shy to share around honesty and connection

~ Open, honest discussion around safety, boundaries, sexuality/
          
          
          
          
          
          
           non-sexuality, and clarity

~ A group of others who are curious, interested in, and supportive of the safe exploration of genuine intimacy


**CUDDLE PARTY**

~ Down tempo, relaxing music and lighting to aid in the intimate setting

~ Complimentary traditional Chinese tea service - another intimacy inspiring social activity

~ A crowd of people who share your desire to connect intimately and comfortably

~ A safe, facilitated space to explore the depths of honest connection 

~ Again, an easy, simple set of rules to maintain a healthy environment in which we can interact with respect and awareness

Concept 04: The Marble Index, by Carlos Souffront

"And from my pillow, looking forth by light 
of moon or favouring stars, I could behold 
The antechapel where the statue stood 
of Newton with his prism and silent face,  
The marble index of a mind for ever 
Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone." 
– from "The Prelude" by William Wordsworth

           carlos-souffront

Carlos Souffront is a music gourmet, a true DJ's DJ. His taste is rich and vast and he has the unique ability to create deeply rhythmic narratives that offer unexpected and exotic spices. He mastered his deep mixing skills with a cassette deck and a belt drive turntable in his father's den in Troy, home of contemporaries such as Mike Servito, Tadd Mullinex and Matt Dear. Equally entrenched in indie rock, post punk, experimental music, ambient, rock, house, and techno, Carlos was always a man of many worlds - with an ability to traverse though them with an unique imagination. There is a mood to his search within sound, something that is heavy, deep yet gritty. Like many Caribbean transplants that ends up in northern colder climates, he wonders where our rhythmic complexity is. For him it is effortless and endlessly surprising to the listener.

Carlos is an important component of the Interdimensional Transmissions parties, bringing a loose yet tight moody deepness and an ever unexpected edge. At the original No Way Back party, he demanded truth in advertising, pushing us to and then past the 12 hour mark. He has participated in the studio with Ectomorph, and also performed alongside some of their live performances.

It is all too rare to find someone within the electronic music spectrum that can be called an original, that you can only really explain to someone who experienced them on the dance floor, usually just by saying "that's so" and saying their name. Carlos is one of those rarities.

           djmossmoss

Mossmoss (aka Mattie Bowen) is a Scottish born dj and producer with an intense interest in explorative music. With a keen ear and eye for detail, he is an artist by nature. His wandering sets paint landscapes of light and dark patterns, textures, and strange melody, heavily relying on atmosphere and tension. Mattie's inspiration draws from the organic details of existence, the tiny pieces most overlook in exchange for the big-picture rush of an ever changing modern world. His mind deeply set to explore these facets and to share his exploration in all forms to those that might look and listen. Mossmoss currently resides San Francisco and draws on The City and its colorful nightlife for constant immersive inspiration.

          ConceptSF

Concept is an experiment in musical communication. 

Concept offers accomplished DJ's the opportunity to select a theme or idea - a concept - to interpret through music. The artist selects both the concept, and its interpretation, and then presents that interpretation in a live set. 

Though artists may include dance music in their Concept, doing so is not required or expected. 

And because we believe that the audience must have the opportunity to fully engage with the artists' creative expression, our comfortable environment supports the deep listening experience.
