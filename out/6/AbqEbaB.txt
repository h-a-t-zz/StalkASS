         False Profit Presents:  The Tuesday Night Party 2015

           Black Rock City, NV—False Profit, Inc., sent shock waves through the stock market with its recent announcement of current plans for its annual Tuesday Night Party (TNP) at The Burning Man Arts and Culture Festival. In a move outside experts are hailing for its boldness and freshtasticness, False Profit, Inc., released news that it would be holding the event not at its desert research field campus proper, but “out in the open.”

“For 14 years, we’ve invited shareholders to our desert campus to celebrate with us,” said Jef Pearlman, Senior VP of Auditory Logistics. “This year, we decided to think ‘outside the camp.’”

Citing ever-increasing attendance, bicycle parking challenges, and the desire for attendees to experience high fidelity sound “en plein air” as forces pushing the party into the open playa, , a spokesperson for the company enthusiastically predicted that this year’s TNP would be “the best evar.”  

Referring to the unanticipated relocation, an unnamed insider also hinted that the main research facility is so filled this year with mad science projects--which shareholders will undoubtedly wish to keep a watchful eye on as conditions evolve--that the decision to shift was “easy peasy”.

“Also,” added Brendan Colloran, Chief Innovator at BlimpCorp, a wholly owned subsidiary of False Profit, Inc., “it’s kind of hard out here for a blimp.” A follow-up request to staff for an explanation went unanswered.

The party will be held on the open “playa” approximately 300 feet out from the company’s primary campus location of 5:15 and Esplanade. This location was chosen due to the giant deep sea fish that will be located there, which analysts expect will protect attendees from wandering shirtcockers, newbs, darkwads, those rich people who are destroying Burning Man, and other unsavory characters. Known as Illumacanth, the fish will delight and astound party attendees with its spikes, lights, and fire. Sound for the event will be provided by the legendary Dr. Brainlove, a project of The Phage, a long-time affiliate company and co-conspirator of False Profit.

          What a week, kiddos. Gallantly gusty breezes, heartwarming hugs and squeezes, churlish and chilly nighttime freezes, all the while exhaling dusty-lunged wheezes.

Some things went to plan, others not quite. What would Burning Man be without a slight bit of plight, forcing us to exercise our might?

Let's reconvene and get cozy, celebrate and hold vigil. Don your pajamas, panda onesies, or whatever-the-what. We'll mull some wine and whiskey, listen to some twinkle-tunes, and make ourselves a suitably soft landing back on reality.

           Join us at Heron Arts for our inaugural open studio showcase, presenting new completed works from a group of artists working across mediums — including paint, metal, blown glass, and digital light projection.

The show focuses on the interplay between artistic personalities and forms. All the artists have collaborated on a single, large-scale piece that incorporates all mediums. Each artist will also present an individual work in their own medium, relating that component to the whole.

          Bay Area Premiere
Obie Award Winner
A Musical Comedy by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman 

January 2 - 19, 2014
Eureka Theatre, 215 Jackson Street, SF CA

Performance Schedule, starting Thursday, January 2, 2014
Wed-Sat @ 800 pm; Sundays @ 300 pm
Sunday, January 5 @ 300 pm AND 700 pm
Must Close January 19, 2014 

From the Alaskan Gold Rush to the Florida real estate boom, Road Show is the story of men and women willing to take risks to grab their piece of the American dream. Spanning forty years, Road Show specifically focuses on Addison and Wilson Mizner, two brothers who are constantly looking for the next way to strike it rich. This quest turns into a test of morality and judgment for the two brothers that will change their lives in unexpected ways.

We have not just chosen any Sondheim musical usually done by regional theatres, but the obscure ROAD SHOW. This musical has had many incarnations (previously titled Bounce, and before that Wise Guys and Gold!), but the few people who have seen it may not have seen this version being presented by Theatre Rhino.

ROAD SHOW, Sondheim's first new musical since his Tony Award-winning Passion in 1994, reunited the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning composer with book writer Weidman (Assassins, Pacific Overtures) and Tony Award-winning director John Doyle (Sweeney Todd, Company). The production played an extended run Off-Broadway at the Public Theater in 2008, but beyond a 2011 London remounting at the Menier Chocolate Factory, the musical has remained unseen by audiences until now.
