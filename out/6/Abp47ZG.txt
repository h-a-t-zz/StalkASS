           The panda Peters are super stoked to bring the Panda Lounge back to the playa this year!  

If you were a patron during our inaugural outing you know what we're all about: a chance to escape the hustle and bustle of Black Rock City.  Fancy drinks, funky beats, and panoramic views of the playa combine to create an experience that's a bit more intimate and refined than your typical Burning Man fare.

Come for a drink and stay for a while - we tend to focus on longer, more involved sets from fewer, higher quality, and quite often sexier DJs.


Here is our schedule this year:

Monday Day:      
Andy Warren

Monday Night:    
Dan Sherman

Wednesday Day:   
Dan Sherman

Wednesday Night: 
MightyKat 5pm-8pm

          EFT is a synthesis of breath-awareness, acupressure, and cognitive behavioral therapy. EFT is likened to an advanced form of self-hypnosis. It runs self-love, self-forgiveness, and self-acceptance through your body's electrical system until your reality shifts. It is truly a magical tool as well as a practical tool. 
 

I invite you to use EFT to heal your heart, align with your life purpose, and transform old patterns that no longer serve you. Each class will cover a different topic including: life purpose, sexuality, love and relationships, creativity, abundance, physical pain, chronic illness, or any topic suggested by the class. 

This class will feature group work, partner skill building, and question and discussion.  

Please bring yourself and your willingness to heal. 
$10-$20 suggested donation or your earnest presence.

          Katie, Meena, Christina and I (Marina) are currently training to participate in the Nike Women's Half Marathon (Oct. 21st) on behalf of Team in Training.  The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training is the largest endurance training program in the US and provides coaching and training in exchange for raising money towards finding a cure for leukemia and lymphoma.

We EACH need to raise $2500 in order to complete this event in honor of all individuals who are battling blood cancers, so we're turning to all you charitable individuals to help with our effort!

We're asking for a minimum of a $30 donation to enter the tournament. Please note that this donation is on a sliding scale- i.e. if you cannot afford to donate $30 then we are more than willing to accept whatever amount you can (in turn, if you are able to donate an amount greater than $30,  we will most certainly accept that as well).  We'll supply all the required materials (i.e. kegs), so just bring your game face (and your checkbook).  And, as this is an open event, feel free to invite any and all of your friends who you think would be down for the cause.

Sloshball not your thing?  Don't worry, there will be sober opportunities to donate as well, so keep a lookout for the Fbook group invite that you all know is coming :)
