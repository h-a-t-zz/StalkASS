         I was born 25 years ago. What does a quarter century mean to you?

          If you are invited to the event it is because you have contributed something wonderful to my life and I would love nothing more than to spend my birthday in your presence. 

I don't know exactly what my birthday will entail yet, but I wanted to invite you now so you will save the date, so there is no possible excuse for not celebrating with me =) My birthday is on a Friday and I will have all kinds of festivities throughout the weekend, from dinner, to an evening party, to brunch, to a service project (maybe something related to my work in Haiti?), hopefully something outdoors, something creative, lots of hooping, lots of dancing, lots of phat beats (who wants to DJ?), and definitely lots of love. 

I'm actually currently looking for ideas and venues, so if you have any ideas for themes, tips from good parties you've thrown, venue possibilities, or even things that you did on YOUR 25th birthday, let me know!

One possible theme I'm thinking of is "25 year old you"- where every one shares either what they looked like and were like when they were 25 (or if you're not 25 yet, what you WANT to be when you turn 25). Especially for those of you who I invited who are faraway or who can't make it, I would love to feel your presence through some kind of contribution about what it means to have lived a quarter of a centure. Feel free to send them to me, or post them on the event wall. 

Looking forward to celebrating with you all in a few short months!

The event is public so you can invite select people you think will be a positive addition to my life and the lives of my friends and people I love and care about.

          Come out to the Homestead on Saturday night to catch up with old friends and meet new ones! We'll be in the space at the back from 7 p.m. on; show up any time during the evening. And though this may not feel like the kind of party to which you need to bring any provisions, the very single organizers would appreciate it if you'd bring along all your unattached friends. :)

          August 18, 1981- Last Day of Camp

Come join us at the new house for some brews, hot dogs, s'mores, and a kiddie pool! 

Proper 1980's summer camp attire required.  The shorter the jorts the better.

Camp begins at 2pm.  Don't be late, though the strong will survive through the night.

          What better reason to be hungover on a Tuesday than this?!  

My birthday a.k.a. the holiest of days in all of Septemberfest falls on a Monday this year and while that might be reason for many to settle for a low key evening, I'm certain that I have enough irresponsible friends to make this work.

Please join me in playing a little bit of my favorite drinking game to soften the blow of turning 25...

Hope to see you there!

Felnious is the main band for the night, but also featured are Dynamic, Audible Mainframe and DJ Illn Ills

Hopefully you're still around despite the 3-day weekend, and can make it!

         Paul's Hoodrat 25th Birthday Party!

          don't let the tagline fool you, this is going to be a classy party. ratty ratowitz wouldn't have it any other way.

paul's birthday was 2 days ago, so it only seems appropriate to have his birthday party 7 days from now. this means you have a week to come up with the rattiest stories, proper ratty* attire, and drinks. as always, the night will end with a 3am dance party, so bring your ratty dance moves as well.

if you don't get the whole 'ratty' thing, its ok. neither do i. just go with it. 

happy birthday paul!

*ratty attire doesn't only have to include dressing like a rat (the animal). you can dress up as the rat pack, cheese (doubles as a wisco treat and rat food), paul on an especially ratty day, etc. bonus shots will be awarded to the best outfit. extra bonus points if you rock the rattail. 

in the spirit of being a rat, i'm sure i forgot to invite people (and i'm not friends with everyone) so feel free to bring peeps:)
