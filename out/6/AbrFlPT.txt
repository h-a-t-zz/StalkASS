          The pendulum always comes back around, right?

Only a year ago we wrested our souls back from the clutches of the great beast, but today we find ourselves right back where we started. Soulless shells of human beings, we are enslaved for a googol years.

But, the upside is that we got paid fat and can throw some seriously killer parties.

Come out in San Francisco on Friday for a celebration of success, and excess. It's been a phenomenal year and we all deserve to celebrate.

** Now on Saturday at Space Gallery! The downstairs bar and entrance will be closed at midnight, so please try to show up before then! **

           Hey all.  With paintball out of the way, it's time to start thinking about our next e team event -- The Go Game.

What is The Go Game?  Nobody knows, because it's different every time.  We will be embarking on a magical journey of fun, puzzles, team building in downtown Palo Alto, all customized around Facebook and our engineering experience.

Take your company to new levels of creativity and cohesiveness with the next generation of team building activities. Since our launch in March 2002, we've made superheros out of companies like Microsoft, Verizon, and Toyota. Find out how you can get in on the game."

* The Go Game goes down on October 29th.
* The Go Game will start in the 164 Cafe, going from 1pm â€“ 5:30 and will end with judging and drinks/food at Old Pro.
* The actual events will be all around Palo Alto.
* Prizes! of nontrivial monetary value will be awarded to the winning team.

Make sure to RSVP, and check the website if you want more details.  But mostly, strap yourselves in because it's going to be a wild ride!!!!!!!!!!!!

          Friends, join us for casual drinks and dessert at Pier 38 (the EtherPad Office) this Saturday night.

We will also be celebrating Queen Latifah's birthday.

If you're never been to our Pier 38 office, it's a mix between a pirate ship, a scene from miami vice, and a 1920s speakeasy.  We also have a mannequin.

We will provide some wine and dessert but feel free to bring something to help the cause!

          James is clearly the best guy we've ever met.   People around the company tell me he's a gorgeous man.  That his very presence eases the tension in a room.  That he is an exceptional engineer.

All I know is that he is hot.  Come let him know at Old Pro this Friday when he turns 26, gets drunk, and tosses his tiles.
