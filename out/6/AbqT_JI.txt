          Ethan is turning 35, Krystel is turning 26, and Janet is turning something in-between (ok really it's her official half birthday at midnight. which half? mum's the word).   So we decided to join forces to create the ultimate Chinese-Jewish birthday celebration: 

**The JASIAN Invasion!!!**

Check out the full party website at www.jasian.com!!

Come meet us at Rosewood Bar on the border of North Beach and Chinatown.  We'll have DJs, food, drinks, and rockin' jasian party favors galore (drinkin' dreidel games? yup!).  Rumor has it there may also be a dance off!

The party will go until 2am but we wanted to keep the Facebook invite clean and not overlapping over two days. 

Remember to use the password "Jasian" to get in with no cover!

           I'm riding in the MS 150 this Spring and need your help to raise money to fight MS.  Please donate $5, $25, $50, whatever you can here:

But I don't just want your money.  So you should join me for Happy Hour at Onion Creek on February 29th and give me your money in person as we celebrate Texas Beer day at the OC.  Then we can hang out!  On Leap Day!  The next chance you'll have to hang out with me on Leap Day won't be until 2016!  Act now!

So to recap:  If you can't come, donate online.  If you can come, donate online and then come.  If you have terrible credit, bring cash and come!  

See you there!

The MS 150 is a two-day bike ride to Austin to raise awareness and money to fight multiple sclerosis.  It is the largest event of its kind in the country and raised nearly $17 million last year.

           We are excited to offer a one night preview of our current work entitled "She Goes Gently into Pine" which will premiere as a larger site-specific art installation this summer. You're invited to join us for a special night at Agape, a historic Victorian mansion in the heart of the Mission. See our work up close before it is transported to a larger space-- enjoying a collection of live dance and music, art installations and an open bar. We look forward to sharing our new work with you and enjoying a special evening of evocative art and dance together.

Recommended to buy tickets online (general admission $20, sponsor $40, gold sponsor) . Tickets also available at the door ($25).
