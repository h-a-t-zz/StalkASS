          Living in a 24/7 technologically wired society is literally re-wiring our brains.

Do you have some type of glowing screen in front of you for all or most of the day?  Do you work in front of a computer, check your smartphone when you’re at lunch, and then turn a computer or TV screen (or both) on at night?  

Are you aware of a sense of imbalance between your mind and body?  Do you feel anxious, restless or easily distracted?  Are you finding that you are developing digestive, physical, or emotional problems?  Do you want to improve both your mental and physical performance?

In this class we will discuss the influence of technology on the neurological development and function of the brain, and how to create balance for long-term health and wellness.

At The Happiness Institute, we ask the members of our community: What makes you come alive? We are engaging with the media creators of the Bay Area, as passion-driven people doing the sort of work and telling the sort of stories that makes communities come alive.

We seek collaborators to help us design the structure that can support an inspired community of content creators. Our space is uniquely designed to support creative professionals: we feature a sound enhancing black box theater with blue screen, and an adjacent recording booth with glass partition. Community members can also explore our coworking space– booking appointments, creating events, and connecting within our network.

This is a private event, but feel free to bring people that are awesome and that you enjoy being around. Also bring food if you can, we'll have a potluck. If you have interactive art or projects to show off, that would be rad.

           FilmFool Gathering 8 is happy to invite you to a screening of "The Advice of Strangers" by Dillon Petrillo amongst a close circle of friends and independent cinema supporters. 

Dillon has been a frequent featured guest at our screenings and we are happy to see his second feature come to light.

The program includes a slide installation by Alex Greenburg about the making of "The Advice of Strangers", a short film "Deer and the Antelope" by Dillon Petrillo that led him to receive a scholarship to actually make his feature film, and finally, the screening of the "Advice of Strangers".
Q&amp;A with Dillon after the screening.

Based on Franz Kafka's Description of a Struggle, the film is divided into three chapters. The first chapter follows Fran, a bored twentysomething, and George, a starry-eyed lover, on a drunken search for a girl after a New Years Eve party. In the second chapter, Fran meets a hopeful drifter, Rio, who tells her the story of The Supplicant and how he inspired Rio to migrate. The third chapter returns to Fran and George's drunken quest. Shot on location in Cheyenne, WY, Laramie, WY, and San Francisco, CA, The Advice of Strangers is a biting and ethereal look at hope, frustration, wanderlust, assumptions, and love.

           I’m selling Super Bowl Squares to raise funds for the Dana-Farber Marathon Challenge as part of my 2015 Boston Marathon run. It’s a great opportunity to benefit a fantastic cause and potentially win some money! Squares are $20 each.

If you want to play, send me $20 per square requested via Paypal.com (mark the payment friends/
          
          
          
          
          
          family to avoid fees) or Google Wallet using my email address, amy.bucher@gmail.com. If you prefer another method of payment, email me or message me on Facebook and we’ll work it out.

Once I’ve received payment (or we've discussed cash/check and I feel confident I can send a bounty hunter after you for missed payment), I will send you the link to access the squares document on Google Drive (make sure I have your email address!). You can add your name to the square(s) you want. Once the grid is complete (or about an hour before kickoff, if not all squares sell), I will use a random number program to assign values to the rows and columns.

Please invite others to play along! The more people play, the bigger the prizes!
