BINGO | RAFFLE | DRINKS | FOOD | BOARD GAMES

** Friends of all kinds warmly welcomed, please share this invite widely! ** 

-------------

It’s time for Team Live-Love-Laugh to gear up for our 10th annual Pan-Mass Challenge (PMC)! The PMC is the single largest contributor to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. Last year alone it donated $45 MILLION for adult and pediatric patient care, and 100% of every rider-raised dollar goes directly to the cause.

This year our team is committed to raising $26,200 in support of the cause. To that end, this year we're throwing a bingo fundraiser to get closer to our goal. It will feature:

* Bingo!
* Raffle
* Drinks
* Some kind viewing party (sports?! movie?!)
* Board games galore...

...and all in the name of life-saving cancer research. 

Come to play, to drink, to observe, to fraternize, to win prizes, but most critically, come together in support of a tremendously important cause that affects far too many individuals and families on a daily basis. Let's #CRUSHCancer together!

ZONGO JUNCTION
Exploding from the center of Brooklyn's vibrant afrobeat scene, Zongo Junction electrifies dance floors wherever they perform. Packed with four horns, and a five-piece rhythm section, audiences can’t help but move no matter where the band is playing. If the Talking Heads produced a Fela Kuti record of Sun Ra’s music, the product would probably sound something like this psychedelic afrobeat outfit. 

In an industry where it has become commonplace to watch bands perform with laptops &amp; backing tracks instead of live musicians, Zongo Junction takes the stage 9 strong. The Village Voice describes their live show as “Sheer energy with the force of a tractor-trailer that roars with power and noise” while the SF Chronicle says that "Zongo Junction plays its own fractured version of Afro-beat and generates an unstoppable groove when it takes the stage."

MAKEUNDER
Makeunder is a polyglot pop band from Oakland, CA, led by singer and instrumentalist Hamilton Ulmer. Like many bands, it began as a solo recording project. The first EP, Radiate, Satellite, featured only a violin, a saxophone, a very tired voice, and a small hand drum, recorded entirely in Ulmer's childhood home on his laptop's internal microphone while his father recovered from chemotherapy. Since then Makeunder has slowly swallowed a handful of guitarists, horn players, singers, percussionists, and orchestral players to perform and record and evangelize. 

The band's work depicts Ulmer's larger-than-life family of misfit artists, and their struggles, digressions, and triumphs in carving out a place in a world not designed for them. Makeunder tirelessly works blocks of stone into crystaline figures of expression using disparate musical resources, be it renaissance motet, art rock, 90's R&amp;B, synth pop, soul, or modern orchestral music, to craft large, powerful pop songs about death &amp; migration &amp; loss. 

ABOUT GREAT HEADLESS BLANK Makeunder's new EP recounts the troubled years after Hamilton's father died of lung cancer, leaving a wake of tragedy and instability. Each song encapsulates a ghost acquired during the period - people, homes, memories lost, youth wrested. The EP is full of confusing joy, unabashed grandiosity, and abrupt seismic shifts, as Ulmer patches together swarms of guitars, horns, strings, voices, synthesizers, and a plethora of found percussion to build a sonically rich landscape upon which he depicts a family suffocated by its verdant grief.

While PC Music constitutes a largely self-contained universe, SOPHIE has travelled a parallel path, appearing first on singles for Huntleys &amp; Palmers and then Glasgow's Numbers label. Though not technically under the PC Music umbrella, his affiliation with the label recently solidified though a high-profile collaboration with A.G. Cook on a project called QT. It was briefly rumored that SOPHIE and Cook were, in fact, one and the same, but a photo of the pair on stage at SXSW suggested otherwise.

Listening to SOPHIE's music, you're tempted to wonder, how could anything so breezy be so dense? Every cubic centimeter of his constructions is packed with detail—helium-huffin
          
          
          
          
          
          
           g voices, tea kettle squeals, Skittle-hued synth leads, plasticized foley effects, beats that careen like weaponized Slinkies—but it's also shot through with an aching sense of emptiness, as though every sound were cushioned in the dread that it might be the last sound you ever hear. Then, after each heart-in-mouth moment of silence, there's that reassuring cartoon zing! and we're zapped back to life, back to (hyper-)reality. I can't help but think of SOPHIE's chain-reaction beats in relation to the spectacular explosions of Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, and perhaps that's because collision plays such a key role in his music. The two opposed forces are, primarily, pop and anti-pop—the catchy and the cacophonous, the deft and the garish. Like the J-pop artist Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, whom SOPHIE interviewed for Dazed magazine, and with whom he's apparently collaborating, SOPHIE seems fascinated by the juxtaposition of the cute and the grotesque—or, more precisely, in the point where one becomes the other.

A.G. Cook

          agcook

A. G. Cook is PC Music's founder and chief theorist. The 24-year-old has credits on a handful of the label's releases—Nu Jack Swung, "Keri Baby" [ft. Hannah Diamond], "Beautiful", Dux Content's "Like You" and Lifestyle—and he's contributed graphics to releases by easyFun and Maxo; it's a safe bet that he's also had a hand in other projects on the label, like easyFun and the Lipgloss Twins.

Before founding the label, he ran Gamsonite, a "pseudo-label" he’s described as "a prototype for PC Music." But for the most part, it seems he arrived upon the scene with his vision fully formed.

For anyone who doubts Cook's genuine, non-ironic appreciation for pop music, that TANK Magazine interview is worth a read. He cites producers Max Martin and Jam &amp; Lewis as inspirations and singles out Scritti Politti's Cupid and Psyche 85 as an example of "'extreme' pop music"—"a really beautiful balance of great hooks, rhythms and sounds." Praising Cassie, he says, "some of her tracks epitomize the minimal, synthetic, almost robotic potential of commercial music, something which can sound crap when it's done badly, but can also become a sort of perfect, untouchable product when done in the right way." To that end, I find it telling that he says he prefers to compose using "very plain sounds, basically the most boring string, flute and piano sounds my computer has": even at its most ecstatically garish, there's a deadpan quality to his sped-up trance anthems. (Perhaps for that reason he reserves special praise for Ukraine's Eurovision 2013 entry, Zlata Ognevich's "Gravity").

Special attention is due to A. G. Cook's DJ mixes, in which he stretches out and explores every possible angle of his aesthetic, from Carly Rae Jepsen homages to punchy preset disco to Teknian's "Sweded" version of Hudson Mohawke's "Cbat", sounding every bit as thin and weird as you might expect. (In fact, despite the wild swings in tempo and tone, PC Music generally works best mixed together. Granted, too much of the stuff can quickly become exhausting, but many of their mixes are unusually short: 31 minutes for Cook's "Personal Computer Music" mix, 14 minutes for his Creamcake mix, just nine minutes for GFOTY's "Secret Mix", and 10 minutes apiece for all the various players on the PC Music x DISown mix.)

QT
http://drinkqt.com/

If there's a complaint to be made about “Hey QT" it's that it's a bit too on-the-nose. QT, we're told, is "a sparkling future pop sensation"—not a person, but an energy drink, or an "Energy Elixir," to be precise, "where organic and synthetic meet to stimulate an uplifting club sensation." And yes, we get it—their music is fizzier than a bottle of Club Mate spiked with Pop Rocks. The dance music scene is already dominated by an actual energy-drink brand, so it's possible to read QT as a kind of subversive statement—cuteness as a form of critique. So far, though, that angle fails to deliver, and QT's deadpan Boiler Room performance didn't necessarily add to the concept. It began with QT's willowy singer/spokesmodel reclining on a chaise lounge, idly flipping through a fashion magazine while a piped-in voiceover attested to the virtues of the canned beverage, and it concluded with a deliberately unconvincing lip-sync of the studio track. Throughout both halves of the performance, at least on camera, the energy in the room looks as flat as a day-old soda.
The Boiler Room performance may be proof that translating PC Music's aesthetic from URL to IRL is harder than it seems, but the song itself is a masterful distillation of SOPHIE and Cook's pipsqueak aesthetic, with a call-and-response hook so simple ("Hey QT! Yeeeeeah?"), it's like the pop-music equivalent of one of Saul Bass' corporate logos. If they can just add a little more of their typical zaniness to the project, they may yet hit upon the secret formula for actual pop domination

           Peeps! 

The PMC ride just happened, but our fundraising is open until October 1, which means there is still plenty of time to CRUSH cancer's ass! 

As such we'll be hopping behind the bar at Elixir to sling you drinks of all sorts for a wickedly wasted Wednesday! We get 50% (more or less) of all TIPS we receive during the event, so please do remember to be generous to your bartenders, because that means you're being generous to cancer research, which can use all the help it can get! 

All the particulars of our team and why we ride are spelled out below. This is a tremendously personal cause and we would so love to see your fine faces on the other side of the bar enjoying some booze in the name saving lives. 

So come on out for some fun. Let's LIVE a lot, LOVE a lot, LAUGH a lot, and more than anything, let's CRUSH a lot! 

And if you can't make it (peeps be busy we know), you can still support the team with an online donation here, if you're so inclined. :) http://www2.pmc.org/

I'm a proud supporter of the PMC because it is leading the charge to beat cancer, and I'm tired of cancer winning.  

Sharon, my sister, married Robyn on a beautiful Saturday in Maine. The next Saturday, our dad, Big Tom, died from bladder cancer on his 58th birthday. It had come so swiftly, and so fiercely, that it truly opened my eyes to the horrible devastation that cancer can cause, and his absence is something that I feel and think about every single day. Time make things easier, but it doesn't make them better. 

Exactly two weeks later, at 5am in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, I clipped into my bike pedals alongside my sister and our other teammates and embarked on my first PMC. Sharon had started participating two years earlier, in memory of Robyn’s sister Wendy, who had just passed away after waging her own courageous battle with cancer. When I joined the team, I was fortunate to do so on such short-notice, and it proved to be one of the most memorable weekends of my life.

The event's exceptional effectiveness is only overshadowed by the overwhelming love, support, and respect offered from everyone involved that permeates each moment of the weekend. From Robyn and my niece, Emily (aka Squirt!) following as our dedicated support team, to the 3,000 volunteers making sure we're fed and taken care of, our family and friends wildly cheering us on at the finish, and the countless community members providing encouragement and gratitude along every mile of the course, there is a mesmerizing unity of purpose that is profound.

This year I'm ecstatic to be returning to the saddle for my fourth PMC. Joining the team this year will be my brother, as well as my wife lending her expertise to our support crew. I love that this ritual continues to be one that brings our family closer together in memory of those we’ve lost, and with every bit of road that passes under our tires, I truly feel my relationship with my dad echoes the slogan of this wonderful event; we get “Closer By the Mile.”

I ride for him; I ride for Wendy; I ride for the volunteers, the supporters and the organizers who make the event possible; I ride to be a part of something bigger than myself, and to make sure we as a community are doing all we possibly can keep our loved ones as close as possible for as long as possible. Together, we can find a cure.
