           Whooaaaaaaa nellie! It's that terrific time of the year once again, where we don our finest dusty duds, slap some tutus on it, make our asses more colorful than a baboon's and shake those tail-feathers.

Join us, from 2pm-2am, on Tu-Tuesday at Short Stack. We're located at 7:15 &amp; G (just off the 7:30 Plaza). Look for the big astroturf lawn and colorful fabrics billowing above.

If this was Chicago in 1871, we would say it's gonna be a real Barn Burner. But guess what... is Chicago? IS NOT CHICAGO. No, this is Black Rock City, and we're gonna celebrate our own brand of Bodacious Bouncy Beats and Bonkers Bass Burner. You've gotta feel it to believe it.

We'll dance all day and night. Our sister camp Om Skillet will be grilling up their delicious gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches for the first couple hours of the party, so come early to get claim your culinary reward and get cheesy!
