This is our piece of pretty from Flaming Lotus Girls this year. Besides many long hours of volunteers' time, we need help making the piece come alive. Your support buys materials, transports the piece, and supports the crew during the building process on the Playa. We hope you will come and join us, whether at the shop making the sculpture, or pushing the buttons some magical night in Black Rock City. 

Your contribution will earn you big karma points and our undying fiery love and kisses! 

Tympani Lambada is a sculptural embodiment of the structures by which we hear and balance. The bone and membrane of the inner ear’s vestibular system is translated on a grand scale with steel and fire, flame effects, LEDs and sound, creating an experience rich with visceral sensuality.

The Flaming Lotus Girls are a female-driven, volunteer-based group of artists who have been making kinetic, mechanical fire art since 2000. Our work stands at the intersection of sculpture, kinetics, robotics, pyrotechnics, and electronic technology. We create interactive large-scale fire installations that engage viewers and invite them to become part of the art. Flaming Lotus Girls’ work is a collaborative process that empowers participants to learn new skills and become experienced, talented and active artists. Through an open and supportive cultural environment, the Flaming Lotus Girls promote creativity, education, volunteer contribution and leadership opportunities.

           Bridging the worlds of software developers, artists, and the City of Palo Alto, the inaugural Super Happy Block Party Hackathon will happen in downtown Palo Alto on March 31, 2012 from 1pm - 1am. Innovation Endeavors, Talenthouse, and Institute for the Future will open their doors to the community in the spirit of innovation by creating the perfect environment for an interactive block. The City of Palo Alto will block off High Street between University and Hamilton. In addition, the day long event will feature: fleets of colorful food trucks, parking spaces dedicated to local startups, and a Hack the Future tent to teach kids to code.

Super Happy Block Party is the 50th Hackathon of Super Happy Dev House — a five year standing community of hackers, software engineers and makers who join forces at monthly Hackathons. In the tradition of Super Happy Dev House, Super Happy Block Party Hackathon is partnering with Dev House’s sister projects, Hack the Future and Hacker Dojo — making ideas, learning, and curiosity contagious.

Highlights of the Super Happy Block Party will include: a Day Star Zome Silent Disco with a live DJ inside; a constellation of LED strip lights laid out on the block for developers to hack; food truck culinary mash-ups, and a cavalcade  of high-tech personalities and founders. 

Some of Silicon Valley's top investors will be holding Office Hours in an alley. Sign up to have a friendly conversation here: http://tinyurl.com/

This event is hosted by Innovation Endeavors, Talenthouse, the City of Palo Alto, Institute for the Future, and Super Happy Dev House with the support and participation of local startups.

          Since I have lost so much weight, I am now training for Bay to Breakers. I have always wanted to do it and now I think I can. I know it's a long ways away which should give you plenty of time to prepare. I will add more info on it as the day gets closer.
