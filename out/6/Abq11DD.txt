------------------

Artist and developer Dmitri Cherniak presents a new series of work titled, “C0un7Ry s1n9ER”. Using code, Cherniak manipulates the ASCII text system (letters, symbols, and numbers) to generate a sombre and unlikely palette for his muse. From a distance, the giant images seem pixelated, but they are made up of ASCII characters which as you move closer to the work, abstract the image itself. 

We are presented with an icon, Taylor Swift, but she is seen through a darker lense. In the tradition of Andy Warhol’s Marilyn, or perhaps even more so Chuck Close, these computer generated portraits can only exist in the present day. They are a lucid look at what a pop icon looks like now and how she is interpreted. Hashed and rehashed online, memed, decoded, their personal photos hacked. Taylor is a starlet in a very different time than Marilyn.
