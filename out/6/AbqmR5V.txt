           A journey into the world of motorcyclists and their stories.

“As long as I can remember, the possibility of moving forwards, be it on a bicycle, a skateboard, in a car and more specifically on a motorcycle has always been part of my life. It fascinates me how rolling the throttle and releasing the clutch generates motion… It is a very personal thing, yet there are so many others across the world who share the same passion as I’ve discovered on this journey.” - Jean-Philippe Defaut

An immersive experience featuring large-scale portrait photography, interviews, sculptures, archival ephemera and commissioned works by other artists. “I am this motorcycle” is an ongoing conversation, a portrait story with fellow motorcyclists and motorcycles: their rides, travels, challenges, encounters, designs, engineering and evolution.

          The Hollywood Hills-born daughter of a horror filmmaker and sister of a cult comedian, Foxtails front-girl Laura Weinbach grew up in a household that embraced eccentricity. Her next-door neighbors were circus contortionists with emus and fang-toothed monkeys as pets and her childhood activities included snail hunting and spying on celebrity neighbors like Slash, Ice-T, and Larry from Perfect Strangers. Laura's upbringing is present everywhere in Foxtails Brigade, from the lyrical imagery to the hand-drawn artwork and sophomoric Instagram cartoons.

Joining Foxtails Brigade is Makeunder and Be Calm Honcho.

           Captured: People In Prison Drawing People Who Should Be

The first exhibition featuring the drawings and paintings done by prison inmates, depicting corporate CEOs whose companies are accused of serious crimes. For over a year, Jeff Greenspan and Andrew Tider asked people in prison to paint or draw people the duo felt should be in prison–the CEOs of companies doing damage to our environment and economy. To help expose crimes masquerading as commerce, the project imagines those at the highest levels of corporate leadership being personally responsible for their companies’ illegal actions. Captured: People In Prison Drawing People Who Should Be opens on Thursday, May 26th, 2016 with an opening reception from 6­-9 PM and runs through June 30th, 2016.

The show will feature all of the drawings shown in the 60­page, high­quality printed hardcover book, Captured. The drawings are not for sale and the 1,000 edition book sold out in a number of days. The show is free and open to the public. Present at the opening will be the creators of Captured, Jeff Greenspan and Andrew Tider. We will be hosting a discussion on the book and attendees will be encouraged to register to vote for the upcoming primary at the opening reception. 

Captured was created by Jeff Greenspan and Andrew Tider with the intent of bringing attention to the abuse of power by corporate CEOs. The two approached the most artistic inmates, who are all guilty of serious offenses, and provided them with the subjects to draw or paint. The lineup was comprised of people in leadership positions of companies that had placed monetary reward over the well-being of humanity and the planet. Those names include the likes of the Koch Brothers, Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs and Sepp Blatter, former CEO of FIFA. Most of these CEOs were in leadership positions at the time their companies’ crimes were committed. Greenspan and Tider chose their group of incarcerated artists based not only on their skills but also on their crimes, which mirrored those committed by the featured corporations. For example, the project includes those guilty of murder and also features the CEO of General Motors, a company responsible for more than 124 deaths due to a defect in car ignition switches, with a fix they knowingly delayed public awareness of.

Greenspan and Tider created Captured t o highlight how the criminal justice system is slanted in favor of those with resources to avoid it. The two went to great lengths to understand the crimes and the criminals behind bars creating the pieces for the book. Most of the artists admitted their crimes and were not asking to be freed, but felt those with such great power and financial resources who have committed equal or worse crimes should be similarly brought to justice. By comparing the inmates with the CEOs, Greenspan and Tider hope to shine light onto white collar crimes and how little they are prosecuted. 

To date, Captured has sold out of the 1,000 run book, valuing at approximately $40,000. They have donated all profit toward efforts to elect Bernie Sanders. This was an obvious fit for Greenspan and Tider as the former Vermont senator’s top issues are holding Wall Street accountable for their actions and criminal justice reform. 

Greenspan and Tider have worked together previously. Their past projects include a guerilla installation of a 100 pound bust of Edward Snowden in the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene Park, a memorial to POWs who lost their lives during the American Revolution. The two collaborated with sculptor Doyle Trankina and installed it illegally (both have accepted summonses). 

Jeff Greenspan is an NYC based artist whose work focuses on activism and social justice. He is a freelance Creative Director, helping brands connect with people. He was BuzzFeed’s first Chief Creative Officer, a Creative Strategist at Facebook, and a Creative Director at BBDO. 

Andrew Tider is an Artist, Entrepreneur, and Masters Degree Professor focused on Ethical Creativity/

*KELLAM (Regenerated NYC | Trifucta)

Kellam has been actively involved in the music scene nationally for the past ten years in many different music genres. This influence is apparent in his sound. He tends to build his sets by integrating several different styles of music with a sort of groovy fusion. He has a knack for selecting melodic tracks with a deep groove and is known for having played innumerable long marathon sets at burning man, and many after-hours events in New York City and Las Vegas.

*Rambo Springsteen (Regenerated, New York)

A product of the 90's U.S. industrial scene, Rambo's initial inspiration for electronic dance music came out of the experimental abrasive synths and ultra heavy percussion as then showcased by artists such as the Nine Inch Nails, Gravity Kills and KMFDM. 

It was only a matter of time before he crossed the chasm that narrowly bridged the U.S. industrial movement with the U.K progressive scene with major influences stemming from jocks such as Danny Howells, Lee Burridge, Ashley Casselle and Parks &amp; Wilson.

It wasn't until the credit market meltdown of 2007 that he was finally able to tame his alter ego lifestyle and focus on mixing records. 

Today his sound transcends the spectrum of electronic dance music ranging from minimal, tech-house and sonicscapes that are completely out of the realm of modern day dance, many records of which date back almost 20 years.

Rambo's mixing style gives inordinate attention to programming and track sequencing, reminiscent of an era when DJs only had a handful of records at their fingertips, not the entire digital music universe.
