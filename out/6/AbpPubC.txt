         Operation Who Gives a Shit about Paul?

          Hey Guys, 
Not to spread bad news about our pals, but if you didn't know, Paul's in jail. But for those of you who haven't talked to him recently, he was really doing better, trying to move to Gainesville, trying to go to college. No nonsense for a while. Regardless he's in there now and I was talking to Trav about it and he said we could mail him letters from time to time and that it really made a difference when he was in jail. 

So I know we're not super ecstatic that our friends go to jail sometimes, but the holidays are here, and he is our friend or at least was for a long time. No matter what mistakes we've all made in the past, Paul made every one of you feel really good at some point in your highschool or college years. It might be cool to show him we give a shit and forget about some of the crap from high school. So don't feel obligated, but if you want to send him a letter, Trav said you can address it as follows:

Paul A. Pritchett
Marion County Jail
700 NE 30th Ave.
Ocala, Fl 34474

Drop him a line to say what's up and tell him how you're doing. Every time I hang out with Paul or talk to him on the phone, he asked me about all of you individually and wanted to know what you're up to. I know he'd like to hear from everyone, especially now.

         The Chili Cheesecake Challenge

          Chili - I made a bunch

Cheesecake - I made a pumpkin one which is my personal favorite of the varietals

Challenge - Arul keeps saying he wants to play beirut, so I'm calling his pansy ass out

We'll have a fair amount of brews on hand and enough chili to feed a small army.  I'm thinking in addition to the standard drinking game fare we should make ample use of our lawn and golf clubs, and naturally the full facilities of TFB are at our disposal.

We'll cover two weeks' worth of reading, plus the final dialogue:

- Contrafactus

- Sloth Canon
- Chapter XX: Strange Loops, or Tangled Hierarchies
- Six-Part Ricercar

See you there!
