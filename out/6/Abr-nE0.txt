          Fucking Julie beat me by one day.

I got my new place all set up (only took me two months), and so now it's time to celebrate. There will be plenty of alcohol on hand. Also really good music. I've been making the playlist my whole life.

So if you live in PA, remember that it's Saturday night and it's just a Caltrain ride away. You can take Caltrain to Milbrae, then BART to 24th street and it's a 5 minute walk from there. You can probably crash on my floor too.

People in SF - it's right near 26th and Valencia.

Ring the bell at 3603 or call my cell when you're here.

          Our resident Catholic [read: Bob] came up with a brilliant idea: throw a party that says, "Hey Lent...IN YOUR FACE!";

If the concept doesn't offend your conscience, we hope you will stop by this Saturday to let us offend your digestive tract with meat, booze, and any other shenanigans we can cook up, on or off the grill.;
