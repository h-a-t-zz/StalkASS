Providing you, the spectator, with enough material to keep your mind turning for days, he'll also have no problem getting your body on the dance floor. No go get you some.

A one-of-a-kind audio-video jam, performances at OneBeatSF are a radical re-imagining of 'world music' - with works created exclusively for this event via a seven-day collaboration-convergen

OneBeatSF's main performance will take place at Public Works in San Francisco on Wednesday, October 15th and is preceded by roving OneBeatSF ensemble performances and video-shoots earlier in the day throughout the city, in collaboration with the creative agency, Projector. All performances are free and open to the public--details on locations of roving performances will be listed soon!

OneBeatSF is sponsored by OneBeat, the touring music residency initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Cultural and Educational Affairs, and is produced by Bang on a Can's Found Sound Nation with Compound, and presented with The Global Lives Project’s "Global Wednesdays" event series.

MARK SLEE

Mark Slee is a resident DJ and co-founder of House-Heads, a San Francisco collective throwing unique underground and private events focused on forward-thinking dance music. He is also one half of Manju Masi, a collaboration with long-time partner in crime Atish. 

Born and raised outside Chicago, Mark grew up on a steady diet of electronic music. Early influences came from eclectic acts like Orbital, Aphex Twin, and Underworld, balanced against an exposure to the more dancefloor-oriented sounds of Chicago house. A student of the piano from a young age, he quickly developed a keen interest in audio production and DJing - an interest he has now cultivated for 15 years. 

Living in San Francisco since 2005, Mark has evolved a style of DJing that uniquely reflects his personality. Technical and introspective, he brings a thoughtful approach to constructing sets that tickle both mind and soul, at the same time topping things off with a healthy dose of groovy, quirky fun. Understanding audio to be one avenue of a larger experience, 2011 has seen him return to original production, crafting custom-tailored tracks for the unique events he produces with House-Heads, often complementing them with interactive LED sculptures that he also creates.
