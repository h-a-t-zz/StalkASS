The entire evening, including open bar, is complimentary (our intention is to have fun, not make a profit), however we encourage your participation with donations to cover our costs and keep this event sustainable...

Our aim is to create an intimate space for play with amazing people, magical energy, and beautiful music.

The artist will not be announced, but has been carefully chosen and flown in specifically for the occasion. 
Your invitation is intentional, we want you specifically to come, and includes a plus one.
This will be a no shoes, no phones affair.

Magazines will be on sale for $10 as well as raffled off throughout the night. 

'Forum' has been around since 1937 as a way to showcase the artistic and writing talent prevalent in the San Francisco community, and blah blah blah you've stopped reading because this is in paragraph form.  So to sum it up:

6pm: MODERN DAY MOONSHINE

7pm: Featured readers*** and open mic (poetry, skits, music, whatever.)

9pm: TBA MUSICAL PERFORMANCE****

10pm: Music, dancing, drinking, and debauchery until your favorite Semisonic song comes on.

           mixapp.com), THE MAGICAL ONLINE GROUP MUSIC LISTENING EXPERIENCE MAY DIE SOON!!! I hope you are all in tears now. Good.

BUT! It will stay alive if enough people supply monthly donations. We are up to $668/month which is GREAT! But we're going to need to push it to get it to $900/month (OR WE WILL CRY FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY!)

SO!  We are going to have A CRAZY PRE-CHRISTMAS MAGICAL MIXAPP PARTY DJ'd BY ALL OF US (AND THEM AS WELL!)

It will even have structure! Everyone who wants to participate will get a time to start DJing (it's easy!!!), queueing enough music to last at least 3 hours (but hopefully MUCH more). We'll stagger the line-up (and publish it) so that everyone is excited and knows, e.g.  "Oh wow I must go on to mixapp at 6:00pm to hear Johnny". And of course you should also feel free just to go on RIGHT NOW or at ANY TIME and queue a bunch of songs! 

AND THEN OF COURSE YOU WILL ALL INVITE EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU KNOW IN THE UNIVERSE AND APPLY "GENTLE SOCIAL PRESSURE" TO HAVE THEM BECOME VIP MEMBERS!

Ok that was long. Here's what you need to do:

If you're interesting in being a MixApp DJ (remember, it's just about queuing music!) for 3 hours (or even less!) please click ATTEND this "event" and leave a wall post below describing when you prefer to do it.

***About the film***
	
Based on Franz Kafka's Description of a Struggle, the film is divided into three chapters. The first chapter follows Fran, a bored twenty-something, and George, a starry-eyed lover, on a drunken search for a girl after a New Years Eve party. In the second chapter, Fran meets a hopeful drifter, Rio, who tells her the story of The Supplicant and how he inspired Rio to migrate. The third chapter returns to Fran and George's drunken quest. Shot on location in Cheyenne, WY, Laramie, WY, and San Francisco, CA, The Advice of Strangers is a biting and ethereal look at hope, frustration, wanderlust, assumptions, and love.

***About the Theatre***

Built in 1908 as a vaudeville house, the Mission District's Victoria Theatre is the oldest operating theatre in San Francisco.  Originally called Brown's Opera House, the theatre showcased grand performances by international stars who came to San Francisco.

In the 1930s, as cinema began to overtake live theatre, Brown's became a motion picture house, and in the 1950s, changed it's name to El Teatro Victoria and began playing only Spanish-language films.

In the 1960s, however, the theatre became a burlesque house and changed it's name, once again, to New Follies.  The theatre subsequently closed in 1976.  Three years later, the theatre reopened, restored to it's original grandeur and eager to show only the greatest of films inside its stately red exterior.

Something better.

Something cuddlier.
