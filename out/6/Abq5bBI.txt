           We're excited to announce a special NEDx event this month!

The Painting Salon is a monthly lecture series that features artist talks at local art spaces, galleries and artist studios. Each month two artists present for 45 minutes each at a different venue in the Bay Area, and the SUB is honored to host this time.

The Salon community is invited to bring drinks and snacks to share. Discussion is encouraged during and after the talks. Artist presenters have included established artists like Alicia McCarthy, Chris Lux and Katheryn Spence, as well as emerging artists like William Emmert and Tamra Seal.

About the Book
===========
North Korean radios that are altered to receive only the official stations. Cars that listen in on their owners’ conversations. Digital video recorders ordered to self-destruct in viewers’ homes thanks to a lawsuit against the manufacturer thousands of miles away. Jonathan Zittrain’s extraordinary book pieces together the engine that has catapulted the Internet ecosystem into the prominence it has today—and explains that it is sputtering precisely because of its runaway success. With the unwitting help of consumers, the Internet is on a path to a lockdown, a closing off of opportunities and innovation.

Zittrain explains that the Internet and much of what is built on top of it is “generative”—it welcomes change from anyone, anywhere. The benefits of generativity are innovative output (new things that improve people’s lives), and participatory input (the opportunity to connect with other people, work with them, and express oneself). But security issues online, like viruses, spyware, and invasions of privacy, will see this generative infrastructure replaced by fashionable “tethered appliances,” including iPods, iPhones, Xboxes, and TiVos. These devices are not generative—they can’t be modified easily by users, even as they are continuously regulated and controlled by their makers. Zittrain offers an accessible discussion of the looming problems of an “appliancized” future and provides a set of visionary solutions to help stop it.

           Hey friends!

We're holding a very special Sub Cinema Sunday this week!

First, we will be screening Douglas Blumeyer's short "The Making of All Together Now." This is a 24-minute film he made in 2007 as the grand finale of the Stanford Film Society's Student Film Festival. He was unable to attend its debut—particularly unfortunate given its reflexive nature—and he'd love another chance to see it with a crowd! We hope you can make it out!

This will be followed by a brief Q&amp;A + wine &amp; snack session. Ask Doug all the questions you like about his upcoming feature film "The Unmaking of All Together Now," for which he will be remaking "The Making." You can learn more about both films at his Kickstarter project page here: http://

Doug: I've been fundraising for only a few days and I've already raised over a third of my budget!! A heartfelt thanks to all of my ludicrously generous friends! Seriously, all I ask for is a dollar. It adds up.

$3000 is my BARE MINIMUM budget, though, and if you'd like to grant me the ability to hire awesome actors and a legit cinematographer, then PLEASE help spread the word! Truly, you can help me best by sharing this link with YOUR friends and telling them to share it too, so my page can reach critical mass and go viral. A film this rich in both thoughts and feelings just doesn't come around everyday—it really has enormous potential—and I'd like to make it as great as it can be! That just won't happen unless I hit the friends of friends market, so I beseech you, SHARE!!

After wine, snacks and Q&amp;A we will watch Mohsen Makhmalbaf's "A Moment of Innocence," the film mentioned in the Kickstarter video as an inspiration for "The Unmaking of All Together Now." It's not easy to do justice to Makhmalbaf's "A Moment of Innocence" in a description. It's a touchingly personal, intellectual, and even political film. It has a lot of layers, but they build delicately in a meditation on the healing power of cinema.

There are multiple bars, multiple dance floors, pool tables, and if you haven't been you should definitely check it out.

I plan to get there sometime around 930pm that night.  Hope to see you there.
