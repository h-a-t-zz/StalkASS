          Have you ever wondered what happy people eat? Would you like to know what foods support true health and happiness? And that's haaaapppppyyy- Like truly happy from the body, mind, spirit perspective.  Like ticked and tingled by energy from top to toe.  Like this feeling is grounded and sustaining.  (Not the superficial happy like "oh I just ate a bunch of sugar and I'm happy till my next crash.)

Join us in an exploration of foods that support the body, mind, and spirit in simply being our natural state.  It's quite a bit revolutionary on the personal and the planetary dimensions.  We will include perspectives from Naturopathic Medicine, Spiritual Nutrition, and the school of life! Be happy on "the inside of the inside."  Bring a "slice" of heaven onto earth!

Offered on a gifting basis.

Your facilitators are Dr. Aumatma B. Shah, ND &amp; Micha'el Bedar.  

Join us.  
You'll be happy you did ;-P

          We are hosting a tent party at our house in Woodside.  We have ample grounds for many, many tents.  We ask you all to organize amongst yourselves the sleeping accommodations.  We will NOT be providing tents.  Once we get the tents set up, we'll have the BBQ grilling food all day, a raging fire, six kegs, and tons of fun.  

Back to the kegs...we will be breaking everyone in the party into three teams which will be selected prior to the event based on RSVPs.  Each team will have one captain, James, Brendan, or myself.  We will then proceed with a good ol fashion keg race.  The first team to slam their keg wins...a prize TBD.  We'll set up drinking game stations in each area to help finish the keg.  We strongly urge you not to cheat (pour out good beer).  

This party will last all night and into the next morning.  We will have parking set up across the street with car shuttles bring passengers and their tents, etc. to the house.  Think of this as an actual camping trip.  We'll be roughing it for a night.  We urge you to sleep over to avoid any issues with drunk driving.  Let us know if you need help finding someone with a tent.  Please chip in $10 for beer and food.  

We are really looking forward to seeing our friends and opening our house for a great party.
