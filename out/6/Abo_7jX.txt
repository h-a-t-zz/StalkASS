           Five years ago, charity: water started with a birthday party. Everyone who came donated $20 and we raised $15,000. We sent that money to Africa and built our first wells in Uganda. 

This year, we're going back to the beginning, and you're invited. 

Please join Scott Harrison and the charity: water team this September 7th to celebrate our fifth birthday with an unforgettable party. 

10 p.m.

The seventh edition of Journey to the End of the Night returns to the shadowy cityscape of San Francisco as part of the Come Out and Play festival. Last year, 2,000 participants helped take over city streets in the name of play, and this year players will once more dash down hidden alleys, encounter mysterious strangers, and change how they experience the city.

Journey to the End of the Night is a free street game played across cities around the world, spreading from San Francisco to Chicago, Washington, DC, Milan, Berlin, Mexico City, Christchurch, and beyond. Players sporting colored ribbons will race through a series of nonlinear checkpoints scattered throughout the city, while avoiding being caught by chasers. Those who survive will be praised and feted at the end party. Those who fall will become chasers themselves, rising in undeath to pursue the remaining runners.  This year, there will be two colors of runners, each competing to get as many of their color as possible to the end point.


For one night, drop your relations, your work and leisure activities, and all your usual motives for movement and action, and let yourself be drawn by the attractions of the chase and the encounters you find there. No bicycles, no skates, no cars, no taxis. You may only travel on foot or by public transportation. Wear comfortable shoes, and bring water. Prizes will be awarded for top finishers and best chasers.


About the Come Out and Play Festival
The annual Come Out and Play Festival seeks to provide a forum for new types of public games and play. Its mission is to gather designers of innovative new games and experiences, and bring those experiences to a public eager to rediscover the world around them. Started in New York City in 2006, 2013 is its fourth year in San Francisco.

Journey to the End of the Night is part of Come Out and Play.  Come for games on Saturday during the day, then stay for Journey!

           Living Dan is living life as you are, who you are, and who you want to be. Nothing is unachievable. Sometimes that means taking the more difficult, less traveled roads; Dan...took the untraveled roads. He was the ruler of his own life's journey. Exploring a limitless world of possibility and happiness...
