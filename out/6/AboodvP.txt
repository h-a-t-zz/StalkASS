PROJECT SHOWCASE

Generation Waking Up. Building on four years of successful youth workshops and leadership trainings, Generation Waking Up is rallying funding and support to create ReGeneration, a high school curriculum that will empower teachers to take the impact of this work directly into their classrooms. Through interactive and adaptable learning modules, students will gain an understanding of today’s global challenges and opportunities, develop 21st century leadership skills, identify their role in creating positive change, and access the tools and resources needed to make a difference at their school and in their community. 

Pacha's Pajamas. The award-winning story, Pacha's Pajamas, is nutritious children's entertainment that builds self-esteem, affinity to nature and encourages kids to create the world they want to live in. Pacha's magical pajamas whisk her off to imaginary worlds where she journeys with the characters on her pajamas. We are raising funds to produce the world's first interactive pajamas and their companion app and story book. Positioning the app over the pajamas and book brings the characters and their stories to life. 

Terra Nova. We design, build and maintain ecological landscapes and gardens in harmony with nature - the Tread Lightly service. This is fossil free landscaping at its finest. 

Bay Bucks. We enable businesses to purchase from other businesses that have excess inventory or extra capacity at a discount. We envision a greater Bay Area where sustainable regional economic growth and development are in service of the people and the environment, rather than corporate profits. We envision an economy that promotes stewardship of our land and local resources, supports local business and innovation, drives re-localization of production, and recreates the market from being merely transactional to a place for community building.

More campaigns TBA.

The SUB presents "Last Thursdays", a monthly showcase of new work by visual, musical &amp; culinary artists who inspire &amp; expand our community. Join us on June 25th as we showcase new works by DART Collective with musical guest Brogan Bentley and James Fish.  We'll have an open bar and delicious snacks for your enjoyment.

DART Collective is a group of collaborating artists based in San Francisco. The artists are motivated  to use art to activate space and enrich time. 

The collective was formed for the purpose of combining multiple techniques, in an attempt to bridge the gap between art and digital mediums.


MUSIC BY—

Brogan Chet Bentley 

"San Francisco artist Brogan Bentley is part of a new generation of music-makers unrestricted by the boundaries of genre, whose focus is on creating a spiritual experience that listeners must define for themselves. Growing up in a family of musicians in California, Bentley’s musical imprints range from jazz singers to skater soundtracks. Bentley debuted his LP The Snake this past November, an album consisting of 12 tracks of melodic storytelling using elements of smoky R&amp;B, ethereal vocals, and ambient beats."  (via SF Weekly)

James Fish

"Electronic music, good people, and thoughtful experience design - these are the essential qualities that serve as the creative inspiration behind every event James touches. The music he makes and mixes is intended to move your soul and get into your head - a melodic and psychedelic twist on dance music. As an avid dancer, he feels connected to the floor whether on it, or playing for it. To him, dance music should be memorable and emotional beyond just the beat." (via Resident Advisor)

________________

The SUB presents "Last Thursdays", a monthly showcase of new work by visual, musical &amp; culinary artists who inspire &amp; expand our community. On May 28th we unveil new works by Harrison Love with musical guest zéro noir. We'll have an open bar provided by Muffin Street Brewery, delicious snacks, and further soundtracking from Popstack for your enjoyment.

So often, art is folded into the forces that herald the coming of cultural revolution.  Art has the power to effect the cultural ecosystem but the predominant atmosphere of fear that we have lived in; this and the commoditization of art as a product, has removed much of its potency and responsibility. Artists have a responsibility to act as a voice, even if our work is silent.  

Join us this month for the RIOT, featuring:
