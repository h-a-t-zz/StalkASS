More fires!
More views!
More DJs!
This time with champagne!

It just so happens that our friend Cezar is turning a quarter century on 10:10am on 10/10/10, which falls 10 minutes after midnight on this side of the ocean. 

Equally important, though less cosmic, are the anniversaries of the births of the mystical Dave Bogaty, the austere Ross Wait, and the pious Alexandra Goldman.

Ross, Blackthorn and Adam Baker will spin tunes. Bring beverages &amp; yr dancing shoes! &lt;3
