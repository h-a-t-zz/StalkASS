Join us for an investigation of art and music dedicated to the melding of traditional instruments and materials and new means of utilizing them. We've gathered musicians, makers and artists who've built their tools to best suit their needs, developed their own unique processes, and/or pushed their mediums to the greatest extent and we'd like to present them to you!
Langton Labs will be transformed into a fantastic art gallery, tea house, and musical venue for just one night. Prints and original works available for purchase.  Come by and see what we've stirred up!

          ENVELOP is a 3D immersive music venue (28.4 ambisonic system) with interactive lights and video, to be installed in The Midway a creative complex opening soon in the Dogpatch district of SF. Using software we've developed, artists can seamlessly compose music that will envelop the listener with sound that moves around the audience from any direction. We believe this is the future of music production. We have currently raised enough funding for the equipment but need the community's support for the final build out.  Help us launch our Kickstarter campaign so together we can make this vision a reality!
