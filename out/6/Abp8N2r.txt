           We will build LEDome at Heron Arts for the first time the weekend before it leaves for Burning Man.

While it's up and running, come create animations for LEDome and see them run on the actual structure!

Some Hack appropriate food and drinks will be provided, but feel free to bring refreshments, especially any dome shaped foods (like muffins).

Can't wait to see what we can dream up!

21+ Event

Chat with the crew to hear about their experience building the catacomb. We are about 61% of our fundraising goal. At 220' across and covering almost 19,000 square feet of playa area, Catacomb of Veils will be the largest art piece at Burning Man 2016 and one of the largest burned sculptures in the history of the event. Everyone participating in the creation of Catacomb is all-volunteer with a commitment to the transformative power of temporary art. Our community of artists and builders is so grateful for your contribution and support. 

Catacomb rises like a rocky outcropping off the desert floor, and as the dust swirls up and around, it evokes Black Rock Point itself. It is a ruin of a previous society-- a remnant of our collective search for moments of quiet, introspection and reflection. It is a journey of discovery and a descent into a subterranean world. Explore with us.

Hello!

"If a full moon falls on Sunday, on what day of the week will the next full moon fall?"

Sounds boring? You'd be surprised at what one uncovers... (check out how an edited version of one of our previous discussions (for which we assumed prior knowledge with algebra) - http://

I've been doing these math meeting/classes for a LONG time, going through various iterations. Now we're taking them online. If you're even remotely interested, you should come since you don't have to go anywhere and it's just 2 hours. You have 2 hours, right?

We are trying to recreate what we see as a true mathematical process -- one in which we don't know the answers, or even if there are answers. We'll be stumbling around, not sure what to do. That's what mathematics is really like. At any point in the discussion if you have questions please feel free to ask (definitely including "I'm not sure what we're doing here" or such). You are encouraged to share half- or quarter-ideas at any point -- a lot of time none of us will know exactly where we're going. It's as if we are walking in some beautiful hilly open area -- there are some trails, and some of us have walked some of the trails more than others, but none of us have been to all points on all of the hills.

We will have planned where the discussion may end up and we'll be striking a balance between letting people "wander" and ensuring that we end up seeing some nice views.

IMPORTANT DETAIL! If you want to be able to effectively interact with our shared whiteboard you probably want to use a tablet. We recommend the $69 Wacom Bamboo  Pen (http://

          BambooPen.aspx) and have a few to share. We will happily meet and give them to interested people in San Francisco, just let us know.

ALSO! If you want to participate, you should probably have a reasonable understanding of basic arithmetic including perhaps some understanding of why long multiplication work. You should _not_ know what it means to say that -2 is congruent to 4 (mod 3). [Though anyone can observe!]

          It's my birthday, and there's nothing I'd like to do more than take some pictures of my beautiful friends. To add some twist to the mix, let's roll with (Alexandra's?) idea of everybody dresses up in the clothes of a friend of your choice.  Then we can all strut our stuff and make fun of each other at the same time. 

With your help, we can add some drinks, sunset, views, music, and all that other good stuff too. Bring your camera / video camera if you want.

FAQ

Q: Can I dress like an alter ego instead of a friend?
A: Sure, whatever's fun for you.

Q: Can I bring a friend? What should (s)he wear?
A: Please do! They can wear anything they want, or abstain from the dress-up/photoshoot if they wish. (But I expect the best of those of you with many mutual friends.)

Q: Afterparty?
A: I'll bring everything I have.

come have a drink or 2 (hundred) with us on saturday night! i'm not sure exactly where the night will take us, but we'll probably start off at the old pro (you may have heard of it:) ) 

we'll probably hop around to other places, so call one of us if we can't be found. (or just look for my new shiny walker)
