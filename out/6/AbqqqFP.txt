          Hey lovers,

Super stoked to announce that the first guest of the New Year is none other than Francis Harris! Yes, the Scissor &amp; Thread label head is coming to San Francisco straight off his BPM showcase to give us a fresh taste of his latest works and finds.

While he became a household name as respected producer Adultnapper, he has truly come into his own as a DJ under his given name.  Francis Harris' set at The End Up for the listed Play party was absolutely mind-blowing and we are still talking about it!  His mixes feel somehow familiar and esoteric at the same time.  This combination of warmth and mystery creates a distinctive dance floor vibe that is as conducive to a vigorous dance session as a story-driven epiphany.  Seriously, can hardly wait to share this with you...

           Between November 13 and 15, writers, artists, videographers, developers, musicians, and others will come together to create content and media around the theme of a Universal Basic Income in the United States.

The ideas for these projects will come from you. Is there a compelling video, an engaging web application, or a cool art project you’d like to create? You’ll have the chance to share it to other participants and work together with them to make it a reality. 

The start of the Create-A-Thon will be spent brainstorming ideas and forming projects groups, but if you already have an idea, you don’t need to wait — share it with others on the wall below or on the website, http://

          rg. And check out the ideas that others have submitted, to see if you’d like to join them in making it happen.

Why Basic Income?
The economy we live in today is no longer working for most Americans. Improvements in technology are disrupting the traditional work model and automating more and more existing jobs. As this trend continues, inequality is increasing, and will ultimately lead to wide-scale unemployment in the United States. If our society is going to survive, we need a radical change.

A Universal Basic Income would provide Americans with an income sufficient to cover basic needs, given directly to individuals, universally and unconditionally. It aims to abolish poverty, eliminate complicated bureaucracy, and grant economic security in an age of increasing workplace automation. Achieving this would free individuals to engage in work of their own choice.

The time has come to start talking seriously about Universal Basic Income in the United States.
