Hey everyone.  

I've been posting links to a kickstarter project I've been working on with a great collaborator of mine William Ryan Fritch aka Vieo Abiungo.  I know sometimes these things can slip by in the feed on the ole social network, SO I thought I would send out a message to everyone and let you know how excited we are for The Thunder May Have Ruined The Moment.  Mr. Fritch has put together some spectacular tunes for a couple videos I put together last year and his label Lost Tribe Sound has started our kickstarter page with some incentives for you to feast your eyes on.  Please check it out!  We have til Jan 25th!  

Happy New Year!

Pete

::::About::::

Afterglow was conceived as a chance to wind down after a long weekend by listening to some chill music and having a few drinks and maybe some dinner with friends. The idea is to allow some of SF's most talented and multi-faceted dance music DJ's an opportunity to dig deeper into their collections and play music they wouldn't be able to in a club setting. Anything's game, from ambient and electronica to dub techno, trip hop, idm, atmospheric drum &amp; bass, downtempo, future jazz, deep house and beyond.

          Burning Man is less than a month away, and since that epic desert experiment is the very inspiration for Tutu Tuesday, this is the best time of the year to get excited about tutu merriment! 

listed artist NAVEEN G kicked off this prized experience 2 years ago so it is with fitting pleasure that we welcome him back for another round.  Resident ATISH and Naveen have a great musical chemistry so we will enjoy a tagging set between them--a masterpiece in the making.  

Our resident painter Tracy Piper cannot be with us this month but there will be no shortage of visual inspiration when NINA MEHTA joins the tutu crew as our in-house visual artist.   

The playa Tutu Tuesday is so worth getting psyched about so if you haven't got a tutu yet, this is your best opportunity to get one before the burn.

$10 or $2 in a tutu before 11pm

          Holy guacamole, mister funky face! We are back at it once again. The delightful denizens of Short Stack (7:15 &amp; B) once again invite you to our stupidly silly, lavishly lurid, stylishly sexy, terrifically torrid Tuesday afternoon affair.

Hrm, whazzat? IT'S TUTU TUESDAY, BITCHES. A dance affair with the utmost flair.

Do it up. Do it up riiiiii-ght. Strap a tutu around that waist and make haste, to 7:15 &amp; B we say! From 2pm onwards (or Tu O'Clock, if you please), we'll be bumpin' and grindin' our way through the desert afternoon with the bounciest of beats. Puttin' some romp in that rump!

Got no tutu? MAKE ONE! Too lazy? WE MADE ONE FOR YOU! Come early to snag one that's snug.

Oh, did we mention our campmates Om Skillet will be serving delicious gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches?? JUST MENTIONED IT. Show up early and eat one. Even if you're lactose intolerant, you'll only regret it a little. They're that good.

WHO IS GONNA PLAY ALL THE SASSY SEXY HOUSE MUSIC THAT WILL SURELY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS PROPER? Glad you asked. This year round, we've plucked our musical pickings from three fine nations.

Kit Seymour - our newest UK import, fresh off the  airboat from London
Roddy "The Ride" Lindsay - SF
Mightykat - Montreal native, Short Stack regular
Atish + Slee - SF
Alex Blackstock - SF

You know you wanna. So brang it, hot stuff. Sissy that walk over to 7:15 &amp; B. Tuesday. 2pm 'til the sun goes down. Be there.
