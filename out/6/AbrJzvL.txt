          Uncover your horns...this meeting of the tribe shall convene as usual at high noon on the day of the birth of someone else's lord.

While the rest of the western world dreams of myrrh and frankincense and [gasp] ham, let's get out there on Christmas day to show 'em how we do:

- dim sum...cheap and delicious, like mom used to make
- movies...about the holocaust [defiance]
- drugs...it's high [get it?] time for a new stereotype

...probably not in that order, definitely repeat as needed.

I'm more than happy to host the parts which need hosting at my place in SoMa. I'll even make sure to have Hebrew [the chosen beer] on hand for anyone who needs to feel even closer to God for a few minutes.

Finally, invite some friends...I know maybe 3 people who will be in the Bay Area that day.

          Thanks to Wayne de Geere III, The American Campfire FREEDOM! Tour, also known as the "Adam Kokesh Avoids His Probation Officer Tour" is coming to the city of his birth! Adam has been using his book as an excuse to travel the country talking about freedom, winning converts, happiness, and psychedelics. He'll have free books and stickers available for everyone.

FREEDOM!
The wisdom within these pages has the power to unlock our potential as a species and establish an enduring civilization based on peace, self-ownership, and nonviolence.

You, as a free, beautiful, independent human being with inalienable rights, own yourself! You can do what you want with your own body and the product of your labor. All human interactions should be free of force and coercion, and we are free to exercise our rights, limited only by respect for the rights of others. Governments rely on force, and force is a poor substitute for persuasion. When you learned “don’t hit,” “don’t steal,” and “don’t kill,” it wasn’t, “unless you work for the government.” Governments frighten us into thinking we need them, but we are moving past the statist paradigm and rendering them obsolete.

This book will empower YOU to be more happy, free, and prosperous, while putting you in a position to help shape our destiny.

Adam Kokesh joined the US Marines at age 17 and volunteered for combat duty in Iraq in 2004. This critical experience showed him that war is a racket and led him to deeply question his most cherished statist beliefs. He first rose to fame as an anti-war activist before branching out into other areas, often taking action too risky for other activists. In 2010, he became an independent journalist as ADAM VS THE MAN. He has been arrested and gone to jail dozens of times standing up for his convictions. He began writing FREEDOM! while caged in Washington, DC. While he has inspired millions with his speeches, videos, and civil disobedience, his greatest contribution to the cause of freedom is the concept of localization as a way to overcome statism and achieving a free world.
