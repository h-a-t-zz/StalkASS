          Join us as we celebrate Matt's departure to the land of shite beer, koalas and endless shrimp on the barbee. It's going to be a large one so we're starting at Tres Agaves at 7pm and pub crawling from there to the Mission via 21st Amendment.

          I'm turning 33 this weekend, and thought it would be judicious to stay in the neighborhood given oMonica is due a few days later. Come by Liberties and have a beer with us, we'll be hanging out there for the evening.

          Come hang out at 10th St and learn of what we are trying to do now. We have spent the past month meeting with people and talking of the future of 10th St and think now we have come up with a legal good sustainable way to keep the place going so that everyone can still use it for events and whatnot. Come by and have a beer and sit around and hear and talk of what we are planning.

Also if anyone wants to come by early because they are attending another event that evening we will be there from about 5 on preparing.

I know this is a little bit more time than I normally give you to plan for this event but I would like you to come drink with me at 10th St because this could be one of the last events here! Just do it!!
