The Kazbah is a burning man sound camp and artist collective with an emphasis on healing. The Kazbah is based out of San Francisco and operating in Black Rock City and beyond.  2013 was our maiden voyage to The Playa and it was clear it we were onto something big. After several successful underground events, we are excited to bring you our first public event at none other than one of the premier night clubs in San Francisco, Public Works.


Rob Garza- 
As one half of electronic music pioneers/producers Thievery Corporation, he has been at the forefront of music and has traveled the globe performing, remixing, djing, recording and composing.

Since Garza’s recent relocation to San Francisco, he has begun a re-exploration of his love for electronic music and beats focusing on Nu-Disco, Cosmic Boogie while keeping very groove oriented and outer-national based rhythms. Recently he has been djing and remixing, taking things to an even more spaced out and trippy level.

The Good Hurt are Seattle based, yet their sound would lead a listener to believe they came from the same golden hills and sunny beaches of Southern California that churned out the likes of Weezer, Incubus, Sublime and The Red Hot Chili Peppers.

As an entirely indie operation they have made impressive strides in their first two years as a band: landing their first showcase at SXSW this past March, recording a debut album funded entirely by their fans and touring coast to coast while selling out top venues in both Seattle and San Francisco.

Their new album, You Are Here, out September 1st – reflects the growth they have made in their young life as a band. The opening track, “In Her Name” is a Chili Peppers-esque freight train demonstrating a new edgy direction and sense of confidence owned by the band juxtaposed neatly against the more laid back beach cruising anthem “It’s All True” riddled with three part vocal harmonies, airy guitars and a wickedly catchy chorus.

Will Krampus make an appearance and eat some children? Only if there are kids here! (Hey, did I mention: KID FRIENDLY!) Will we get the giant tangle of Christmas lights untangled and put up by next weekend? Maybe.. where's the intern? One thing's for sure: we've got lots of things and much more stuff in the art gallery, and some of it can go home with you.

2015 ain’t over yet, kids, and we’re using every last day in December to send it off right.

           Mamasaurus rises again!

Within each of us remains the DNA of powerful creatures of yesterday: tyrannausarui, steggasauri, velociraptors, pterodactyls, and more. Science and art have found the most majestic creature, whose harmony with its environment was so complete, that all of us, its children, are alive today: Mamasaurus. 

Come shake your scaly dino tail with us as we celebrate the return of Big Mama to the playa! On Wednesday evening, as the sun sets over the western mountains, Mamasaurus will come alive, serving chicken fried dino, raptor rosé and prehistoric beats for all of her children. 

Let Mama take care of you in her jurassic oasis. Hang out in her plush dinosaur egg-filled belly or watch the sun set over Black Rock City from Mama's crow’s nest 25 feet above the playa. Shout YAAAS! as you boogie to some of the finest beats from around the world.
