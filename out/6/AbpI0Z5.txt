          A mere 27 years ago, you might have gotten this poem in your mailbox from my parents:


At 3:47 am on the twelfth,
David Bogaty made news of himself
His mother was laboring with his father right there
The first thing they saw was a little head of hair
His shoulders burst in to a room full of joy,
And then came enough, that we knew "It's a boy"
He really is cute
A genuine de-lighter
We think all in all
He was worth the all nighter!


come celebrate!

          Please come join the Causes team, non-profit partners, friends of the company, Freddy Krueger and anyone else who shows up for the first Happy Hour (and Friday the 13th) of 2012. 

What better way to kick off a new year than free booze, free snacks and a free "Million Dollar" view of San Francisco from the Causes porch. Plus, space heaters to keep the night warm and the smokers happy!

Bring yo' wife. Bring yo' friends. But hide yo' kids. We will tap the kegs at 6pm and have beer pong and Russian ping pong ready to go. 

Please try to RSVP so we have a decent idea on how many people will be showing up.

Since first bursting onto the scene with the now classic album Wide Angle in 1999, the Swansea, Wales-based Hybrid have been known as one of the most forward thinking and technically skilled acts in electronic dance music. 
For an act as enduring and versatile as Hybrid, with a career that spans more than 13 years and four albums, it should come as little surprise to find that live performance comes in many shapes and sizes. 
While the full Hybrid Live show has rocked festival stages and concert halls worldwide, with a line-up ranging from the band’s core three members to a full philharmonic orchestra, the Hybrid Soundsystem takes things right back to their gritty roots – one man, at the beating heart of the dancefloor. 
But this is not just any DJ set. Already an accomplished DJ in his own right, the Hybrid Soundsystem sees Chris Healings take things one step beyond the turntables, bringing you a whole new way to experience the group’s trademark musical fusion. Whether it’s through brand new productions and remixes, re-edits of classic numbers or tracks taken from their label Kill City, the Soundsystem show brings you the clubbier side of Hybrid in exactly the way it was always intended, but never before realised. 
With a remix résumé featuring the likes of UNKLE, Doves, Guy J, Elite Force, Losers and Radiohead, HSS productions combine energetic drums, sweeping orchestral manoeuvres and snarling, visceral bass to create a sound that’s at once epic and uplifting, yet with a dark, brooding undercurrent. Taking influences from across the dance music spectrum and twisting them into something resolutely fresh and unclassifiable, this is where the boundaries come down and the rulebook lies in tattered remains. 
Think you know Hybrid? Think again. This is the Hybrid Soundsystem
