           No one says it, but we all know what birthdays are really about: GIFTS.  This year i'm turning 30, so i can set all pretense aside. I want you to celebrate with me, and i want your gifts. 

THE VISION: 

We gather together to spend the day SHARING OUR GIFTS with each other and the surrounding COMMUNITY. Within the Happiness institute we'll CRAFT and CONSPIRE while flowing in and out to the streets to spread the love.

The only requirement is that your gift is something you'd LOVE TO GIVE. If you can't think of anything, then think of a person you'd LOVE TO CONSPIRE with, and work together. 


THE TASK: 

1. Between now and then, come up with the kind of gift you personally would love to give .  JOIN WITH FRIENDS to come up with fun ideas. 

2. Speaking of friends, please invite anyone who'd enjoy this mission. 

3. Write your gift plan on the wall to inspire/recruit others to your vision and to help me facilitate/
          
          
          
          
          
          coordinate.


Whether you love to cook, make art, make music, dance, socialize, love the earth, meditate, teach yoga, clean, there is a place for you. Here's some thoughts to get the juices flowing: 

 - tasty snack treats
 - artistic handouts to passersby
 - chatting with strangers
 - cleaning the streets
 - sidewalk chalk art
 - flashmob
 - dance party in the street
 - guitar jam session 
 - hand out flowers
 - make crafts to hand out
 - meditate on the sidewalk
 - do your yoga, bring extra mats 
 - set up an advice booth
 - set up a joke booth
 - dramatic poetry readings
 - give a talk
 - give compliments
 - Ninja tag people with stickers, cards, quotes
 - dress as a clown
 - wear your tutus. 
 - make a park out of a parking space
 - make grilled cheeses or shady waffels
 - tag people with random acts of kindness
 - film the event
 - take photos
 - draw portraits
 - show movie clips
 - put up a light show
 - DJ
 - dance
 - wear costumes / handout costumes

THE LOGISTICS:  I love structure, so there will be some to help organize the flow of the day. I plan to send out further instructions as the day approaches. 

I know you people, and with our powers combined, i bet can show Market street love like it's never seen before. Wanna try? 

With so much love it hurts sometimes, 

Leah.

           THE APOCALYPSE
It is the end of days. Of the most sacred scripts, the ancient Mayans marked the end of their calendar on the twenty first of December in the year two thousand and twelve. And on this day, you will release yourself into the darkness; we will spend it together, and alone. 

YOU
You will come dressed for darkness in your blackest blacks, for sunlight will never come to see any other colors. Where you end and the night begins will be unknown. Channel your most hedonistic and human desires, for this is our last night. This is the time for your headdress, your duster, your masks, your boots, your capes and all of your Mayan garb. Tutus and purple spandex are best left to wither away elsewhere.

PHONES &amp; CAMERAS
Sir Dillion Petrillo will photograph our last night on Earth. Should you need your mobile phone, please privately step into dark corners for farewell calls and messages to loved ones. Devices should otherwise be tucked in your boot, pocket or breast.

Absolutely no loitering or smoking outside the event-space is permitted. The neighbors will be performing private rituals that require silence. Be respectful and leave no trace.

REQUIRED TICKET [SOLD OUT]
Friends and lovers are welcome but a ticket is required and must be purchased in advance and are now sold out. Absolutely no tickets will be sold at the door. To preserve these spiritual grounds, the location will be released the day of this private event. Send a message to the host if the ticket price is outside your budget. Been planning this since 2009. Apocalypse Night is a Silhouette production.

           *********


I'm turning 29!  Help me celebrate the last year of my 20s with ridiculous amounts of alcohol, some Bootie shaking, and short shorts!

Short shorts?  Yes!  That's the theme for my party.  I consulted many professional party people and we thought this would be the most fun.  Spandex, daisy dukes, short khakis, jean shorts, cotton shorts, short skirts, anything short.  The more ridiculous the better.  (See below for more ideas.)

We'll be warming up at my apartment in SOMA and then heading over to DNA Lounge for some Bootie action.

Here's the details...

Pre-Bootie Warm Up at Clifton &amp; Maneesh's Apt
 * 175 Bluxome St #326 in SOMA
 * 830p - 1100p
 * Bring some booze if you want or PRESENTS!
 * Don't forget the short shorts...

We'll then cab or walk over to Bootie.

Bootie at DNA Lounge
 * 375 11th (at Harrison)
 * 1100p - 200a
 * VIP Guest List &amp; Private Table (see below)

To get on the VIP List at Bootie do the following by SATURDAY, APRIL 25 at 12p NOON...

1.  Email me or FB msg me and any guests who are coming.

2.  Send a Paypal payment of $12 per person to bootie@bootiesf.com.
          
          
          
          
          
          (You can skip the whole Paypal thing and pay at the door but you MIGHT have to wait in line.)

3.  Come to Bootie via the VIP entrance (left side of the door), tell em your name and skip the payment window.

4.  I'll have a private table upstairs near the bar overlooking the main dance floor.


What do you mean short shorts?
 * Any shorts shorter than what is tastefully acceptable to go out in public in.  
 * I don't care what theme you go with just sure the shorts are short.  Skirts are ok too ladies.

          journalist Don Lattin will talk about his new, critically-acclaimed book The Harvard Psychedelic Club, telling the story of how three brilliant scholars and one ambitious freshman crossed paths in the early sixties at a Harvard-sponsored psychedelic-drug research project, transforming their lives and American culture and launching the mind/body/spirit movement that inspired the explosion of yoga classes, organic produce, and alternative medicine.

This presentation will emphasize the cultural significance of the four men described in the book: Huston Smith, tirelessly working to promote cross-cultural religious and spiritual tolerance. Richard Alpert, a.k.a. Ram Dass, inspiring generations with his mantra, "be here now." Andrew Weil, undisputed leader of the holistic medicine revolution. And, of course, Timothy Leary, the charismatic, rebellious counter-culture icon and LSD guru. Journalist Don Lattin provides the funny, moving inside story of the "Cambridge Quartet," who crossed paths with the infamous Harvard Psilocybin Project in the early 60's, and went on to pioneer the Mind/Body/Spirit movement that would popularize yoga, vegetarianism, and Eastern mysticism in the Western world.

It was meant to be a time of joy, of peace, and of love, but behind the scenes lurked backstabbing, jealousy, and outright betrayal. In spite of their personal conflicts, the members of the Harvard Psychedelic Club would forever change the way Americans view religion and practice medicine, and the very way we look at body and soul.  This lecture and reading will tell the inside story of the book's creation and prompt a group discussion about the impact that psychedelic drugs have had on the way we live our lives today. Don will also show some rare - and hilarious - film footage he has found documenting early LSD research in the 1950s.
