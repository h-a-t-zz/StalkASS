           Wankelmut ( Get Physical Music, Berlin)  ***First SF Appearance!***
+Rachel Torro ( Panda Lounge, Morning Gloryville San Francisco)
+Eric Jacobs


For his 24th birthday, in December of 2011, the Berlin DJ Wankelmut aka Jacob Dilßner added his sound-cloud touch to his bootleg remix of Asaf Avidan. Under the name „Reckoning Song /
          
          
          
          
          
          
           One day“, the title conquered the charts and, according to the Media Control Single Charts, reached 1st place, and the double platinum status in Germany. The legendary remix was placed number one of Single Charts in eight European countries. It was the most downloaded track of Beatport 2012 and an Airplay Hit all over Europe. Looking back, 1,5 million Singles were sold, and it was played 125 million times on Youtube.
Wankelmut, who had played until then in Underground Berlin Clubs, was widely booked within Europe. In particular the diversity of his entertaining music between Deep-House and Techno that Wankelmut presented as performing as a DJ, helped him to obtain a respected and recognized status within the German electronic music and the DJ industry. At the end of 2012 the famous Electronic Music Magazine GROOVE distinguished him as the „Newcomer of the year“.
During 2012 he developed a closed relationship with the renowned Berlin label „Get Physical Music“, with whom Wankelmut started in the fall of 2012 his own Mix-Compilation-Series
          
          
          
          
          
          „Wankelmoods“, and in January 2013 released his Club Single „My Head Is A Jungle“. Wankelmut obtained for this title the collaboration of the Australian singer and songwriter Emma Louise. With the remixes of Gui Boratto, Kasper Bjorke and Solee, this title was not only a Club-hit in Europe, but was also placed in the Top 20 of the Single Charts of many European countries. The „MK Remix“ of „My Head Is A Jungle“ was during the summer of 2013 one of the biggest hymns played on Ibiza, the support of Pete Tong and many other DJ´s provided for abundant Wankelmut fever within the UK and the USA.
After a multitude of renowned remixes and worldwide DJ Gigs, among others for Gossip, Talisco, Bo Saris or Karin Park, the new Single „Wasted So Much Time feat. John LaMonica“, is currently in release phase. Featuring the American singer John LaMonica, an active as a member of the group Robots Don´t Sleep , he delivers here another vocal Club-hit. In April 2014, the new Single is released on Poesie Musik, with the remixes of Kölsch, N´to and Kiwi. In parallel is coming on the market in June 2014 the second part of the Wankelmoods Mix Compilation, also with Poesie Musik.

This mashup has culminated in an orchestral style that will shock and amaze in all the right ways, so be sure to check your responsibilities at the door, and allow yourself to carelessly dance the night away.

Yassou Benedict
==========
A rare bird, Yassou Benedict breathes life into their lyrics, with provocative instrumentals and vocal harmonies sweet like honey, and just as thick. Fronted by a femme fatal that will make your heart skip a beat, this is one indie pop band that will both shut you up and have you screaming for more. Do yourself a favor and get a front row seat.

Tidelands
=========
Another SF gem, Tidelands, makes their way across the bridge to offer up some musical treats for all so inclined. An orchestral indie duo with lyrics meant to stir more than just your hips, they drop bits of knowledge in between the horn section, looped guitars, keyboard, and yes...all those fabulously accented harmonies.

           ConceptSF

Concept is an experiment in musical communication, via the art of the dj. 

Concept offers accomplished artists the opportunity to select a theme or idea - a concept - to interpret through music. The artist selects both the concept, and its interpretation. He or she then presents that interpretation in a performance at Mercer Nightclub &amp; Lounge in San Francisco. 

Though featured artists may include dance music of various forms in their performance, doing so is not required or expected. 

And finally, we believe that the audience must have the opportunity to engage comfortably with the artists' creative expression. So our listening environment supports the musical experience.

Naveen G is no newcomer to the scene having made his start in 1996 hosting his own show on the influential WNUR 89.3FM Streetbeat Radio that launched the careers of many of his peers originating in Chicago, like Kate Simko, Grayarea and m50. Having caught the attention of world class djs with his very first productions which were licensed to the seminal Global Underground series, Naveen G has fostered his own sound, one that is constently hailed as exploring the late night side of the dancefloor, straying far from the conventional formula, yet still garnering acclaim from DJs and clubbers alike.

From minimal to progressive and everything in between, Naveen G's productions reflect his DJing ability to adapt to the crowd or a headliner, drawing on his diverse range. Equally comfortable warming up a room properly or playing on his own deep into the night, Naveen has brought his unique and varied style to the unsuspecting dancefloors across the world from South America to Asia, where they have learned to expect the unexpected.
