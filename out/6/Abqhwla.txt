BART to Lake Merritt (Fremont or Dublin Pleasanton line from the city), it's a ten minute walk away so call Tracy and she'll tell you where to go or we'll meet you at the station.

          we are having a party because we are not in jail and/or are no longer in jail. in case that wasn't clear. if you know what i mean, then you will be there. if you don't, come and maybe we will tell you.

due to requests made by the residents of marks 302 no one currently incarcerated is allowed to attend. or more specifically, "krysia, don't bring your ghetto, delinquent trash to our room." out of respect for your personal belongings and stereo equipment, i will abide. but let me remind you, no one goes to jail for following the rules.
