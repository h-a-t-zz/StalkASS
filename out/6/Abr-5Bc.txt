In conversation with Loic Le Meur and Soren Gordhamer

Matthieu Ricard is the author of the new book, Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World.  Buddhist monk; PhD in cellular genetics; founder of Karuna-Shechen, a humanitarian organization that’s completed 140 projects in the Himalayan region;  active in scientific research on effects of meditation on the brain; and author of many other books; accomplished photographer.  His TED talk on happiness viewed nearly six million times. www.matthieuricard.o

Sometimes called the "happiest man in the world," Matthieu Ricard is a Buddhist monk, author and photographer. He is one of th emost revered teachers of our time, integrating ancient wisdom into modern life.

After training in biochemistry at the Institute Pasteur, Matthieu Ricard left science behind to move to the Himalayas and become a Buddhist monk -- and to pursue happiness, both at a basic human level and as a subject of inquiry. Achieving happiness, he has come to believe, requires the same kind of effort and mind training that any other serious pursuit involves.

Join us for a unique evening with Matthieu, in conversation with Loic Le Meur and Soren Gordhamer.

All proceeds over expenses will be donated to Matthieu's Foundation.

Brandon Eaves-special early "Eaves" set

 with a raffle giveaway of  The Tracy Piper panda print!

$20 door donation

With it's first appearance in 2011, the Panda Lounge Sky Bar is now legendary. With its 360 view of Black Rock City, it has attracted some spectacular artists including Lee Burridge, Atish, Hoj, Slee and Montreal's Mightykat.  There are nights that began before the sun went down and didn't end until after the sun came up. People have forged friendships under the Panda umbrella...and they have fallen in love. 

This kind of magic-making takes unwavering passion, hard work and...money. So we are throwing a fundraiser that highlights the best of what we have to offer: great music, lovely people and light hearted libations.  If you aren't going to Burning Man this year, here is your chance to participate in the makings of another celebratory experience.  If you are going, you will be proud to know that your hard-earned dollars are going towards creating even more wonderful memories for all of us out on 8:30 &amp; A.  It feels good to give. It feels even better to give and have a great time at the same time!

Tonight, these Djs are donating their time and talents to relaunch the Sky Bar among the stars. Eduardo Castillo is taking time from his busy schedule and flying up from LA to play an extended late night set! Rachel Torro is warming up the decks with a style and finesse that is all her own. We just added Laura Lisbona, fresh off a truly epic Stretch, party and Brandon Eaves will show us what The Space Between is all about-friends, fun, and family.

There will be drinks, there will be dancing, and there will be PANDAmonium! Please support your local pandas &lt;3

Show your support for one of the best camps from SF at Burning Man featuring local loves and surprise guests! This is how we do it, San Francisco. Hope you can join us for this cosmic voyage!

MOZAIC 
(Travieso, SF)

DJ, singer &amp; producer hailing from San Francisco. On any given weekend, if he's not behind the decks you'll likely find him in front of them, making for a true dancer's DJ- one who's built a reputation on solid mixing and fearless genre-hopping: "lowrider techno", hallucinogenic house, dubby disco, and deep garage all find their way into his arsenal- often within one set.

           david-gregory

David Gregory fell in love with electronic music at the age of 14. Three years later, he bought his first synthesizer. After a while of dabbling in electronic music production, David decided it was time to follow his dream of being a DJ and producer. He came on the DJ scene in 2008, and quickly made a name for himself. David has played alongside many renowned Djs including, Mark Knight, Danny Daze, Anthony Attella, Behrouz, Paul Thomas, and many more. The music he spins is very diverse, ranging from obscure techno to well-known house hits. This eclectic mix of underground and popular sounds creates a unique sound and vibe that everyone can enjoy, and that only David Gregory can effectively deliver. David Gregory has proven to be one to watch for, and his sets are a must-hear."

          djdansherman

San Francisco-based Dan Sherman is a resident DJ for Qoöl (qoolsf.com), the longest-running and one of the most well-respected electronic music events in San Francisco, founded by the legendary duo Jondi &amp; Spesh well over a decade ago. In his residency for Qoöl, Sherman has acted as a promoter for the event and has played alongside a wide variety of talented DJs, including Hoj, Spesh, Gavin Hardkiss, Kenneth Scott, Kevin Knapp, Jay Zimmerman, Nikita, Nomad in the Dark, Will Spencer, William Wardlaw, Nick Williams and many more. In August 2013, Sherman and his musical partner-in-crime, Alex Blackstock, opened for Nico Stojan during the Burner Bon Voyage Part Deux event, produced by the highly esteemed Listed Productions crew. Very shortly thereafter, Sherman and Blackstock played the intimate late-night closing set for Tutu Tuesday in Black Rock City, following performances by Mightykat, Mike Khoury and Naveen G, among others. In mid-December 2013, for the premiere of Freak ‘N’ You at Harlot in downtown San Francisco, Sherman will be opening for Philipp Jung of M.A.N.D.Y. Per production work, Sherman has remixes out on Loöq Records and additional remixes on the same label are forthcoming, as is a remix of Cathedrals’ “Unbound.” Sherman also has an EP and several collaborative projects in the works for 2014. Historically, the Midwesterner’s long-held affinity for electronic music dates back to his falling in love with the sounds of artists such as The Orb, Future Sound of London, Leftfield, Chemical Brothers and Propellerheads, to name just a few. Sherman’s beginnings as a DJ trace back to Vinyl, an improbably popular house music event he co-founded in 2001, which took place every Thursday at an international bistro in Ames, Iowa, and which lasted well into 2008. From there, Sherman took a hiatus from music while in graduate school on the east coast. He moved to California in 2011 and renewed his involvement with music in mid-2012 after moving from Oakland to San Francisco.
