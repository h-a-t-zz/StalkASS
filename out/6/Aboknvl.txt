           These are times that are calling the generations to come together.

Join Generation Waking Up, Thrive Bay Area, Impact Hub Oakland, and community partners for a special event called "Wiser Together - Collaborating Across Generations."

This will be the first event in a series of intergenerational convenings bringing together youth, adults, and elders from around Oakland and the Bay Area. The purpose of this series is to build community connections across generations, to unleash innovative solutions, and to support intergenerational collaboration around local community projects.

During this first event, we will use the World Café conversation methodology to explore the questions: What are the gifts we each bring as a generation? What are effective approaches for intergenerational collaboration? What is our vision for the future of our communities and how can we work together to make it happen?

Live music and performing artists will kick the night off. Snacks and beverages will also be provided.

Tickets are a sliding scale of $10-20, and no one will be turned away for lack of funds. People of all ages ready to engage in community conversation are welcome.

Bring a younger. Bring an elder. Bring your community!

ABOUT CONCEPT

www.concept-sf.com

Concept is an experiment in musical communication, via the art of the dj. 

Concept offers accomplished local artists the opportunity to select a theme or idea - a concept - to interpret through music. The artist maintains complete control over the selection of the concept, and its interpretation. He or she then presents that interpretation in a live performance at Mercer Nightclub &amp; Lounge in San Francisco. 

Please note that this is not a dance music event. Though featured artists may include dance music of various forms in their performance, doing so is not required or expected. 

Finally, at Concept we believe that to facilitate communication, the audience must have the opportunity to engage comfortably with the artists' creative expression. So our listening environment supports the musical experience.

Mattie Bowen is a Scottish born dj and producer. With a keen ear and eye for detail, he is an artist by nature. His wandering sets paint landscapes of light and dark patterns, textures, and strange melody. 

Mattie's inspiration draws from the organic details of existence, the tiny pieces most overlook in exchange for the big-picture rush of an ever changing modern world. His mind is set deeply to explore these facets and to share his exploration in all forms to those that might look and listen. 

Mossmoss currently resides San Francisco and draws on The City and its colorful nightlife for constant immersive inspiration.
