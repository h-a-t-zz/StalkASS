----------
Police in Minnesota and Louisiana just killed two more Black men. The cops have murdered 562 people of color and poor people this year alone. The majority are Black men and women. These killer cops know that they will never face jail time. This is state-sanctioned terror directed against Black, Brown and poor people. Join us in the streets Friday July 8 in San Francisco to demand justice for all the victims of police brutality and end to racist police terror. 

Also: Join the protest tonight, June 7th, in Oakland at 7pm at Oscar Grant Plaza.

           Opening Reception: Saturday April 16th 6-9pm
Show is open until May 14th
Gallery hours are Wednesday-Saturday 3-7pm

A group show of eleven national and international contemporary artists who create figurative kinetic sculptures in the pursuit of compelling narratives. This will be the first gallery exhibition of contemporary fine art automata in the United States. Curated by Heron Arts director Noah Antieau and Atlanta-based automata artist Tom Haney, exhibiting artists were chosen based on their craftsmanship and lifetime dedication to this artistic medium. Exhibiting artists include: David Archer (AUS), Chris Fitch (USA), Nemo Gould (USA), Tom Haney (USA), Thomas Kuntz (USA), Pat Keck (USA), Richard Landon (USA), Paul Spooner (UK), and husband and wife collaborators Dean Lucker and Ann Wood (USA). Alongside the eleven automata artists will be San Francisco-based painter, David Marc Grant and his playful landscapes featuring smoke stacks and machinery. Through his work Grant opens a dialogue on geopolitical issues with colorful landscapes, structures and technology drawn from ideas of various utopian and dystopian fictions, drawing influences from the constructivist/
          
          
          
          
          
          supremacist movement, Persian miniaturists, op, pop, advertising, comics, science fiction films, and contemporary low-brow.

Made from a multitude of materials and encompassing a wide set of skills from sculpture and painting to mechanics and engineering, the selected artists in Perpetual Motion: Contemporary Interpretations of Fine Art Automata create work that depicts human and animal figures in animated motion to achieve moving vignettes. This group of artists maintains an aesthetic of nostalgia while presenting contemporary subject matter. 

Dating back to Hellenistic Greece, Automata — or simple machines designed to follow a set of predetermined instructions — have long captivated the human imagination. Experiencing a resurgence during the Renaissance and through the Industrial Revolution, automata were still largely playthings of the rich; elaborate adult toys displayed and enjoyed by merchants and royalty in private settings. With the European democratization of assets, the emergence of a working middle class and an expansion of leisure time, these precious objects eventually became available for public consumption through arcades and museums, in what scholars refer to as the Golden Age of Automata from 1848-1914. 

While accounts of wealthy Americans traveling abroad and enjoying the automata attractions do exist, the artistry and craft remained with its European lineage and, eventually, its popularity as a European cultural pastime faded. Fortunately, this unique medium is experiencing a newfound audience in America and, for the first time, a collection of American automata creators are being shown together alongside British, European and Australian artists in the first group show of professional artists who make contemporary automata sculptures.

           After an incredible night last November, when the Cityfox and listed team built a mind-melting pop-up club in a sprawling, 2-story art gallery in the heart of SoHo, they return to work their magic to transform the entirety of Output, The Panther Room, the Rooftop and Stilton House for a 16 hour day-into-night affair beginning on the roof and spanning 4 stages of music.  It's a full day of Monkey Business. 

Cityfox, the Zurich based label, production crew and renowned club, with support from San Francisco based listed Productions, goes all out to convert these new but familiar spaces to something nearly unrecognizable with visual, light and art installations by Dario Desiena and the Cityfox Art Team throughout.  Starting on the roof and moving indoors as the sun sets, Cityfox and listed will combine their production values with their sophisticated but sultry brand of music to create a full on sensory event for the audience.

In addition to stars from the the Cityfox and listed rosters and a bevy of local favorites, Cityfox and listed are excited to welcome three seminal artists to the Experience: Daniel Bell, Three and Jay Tripwire! 

Join Cityfox and listed at Output, The Panther Room and roof, and the adjoining Stilton House on Saturday, July 13th, for a day and night not soon forgotten.

ARTISTS

ADRIATIQUE
Adrian &amp; Adrian are two guys from Zurich who started off on a traditional route into music just like everyone else, trying out several instruments and learning to scratch on their grandfather’s turntables. 90’s dance, hip-hop &amp; house stuff influenced one of them while the other explored melodic sounds and Europe based techno. In 2008, they met on the road and forged their formidable partnership. They love to mix up different styles to make their sets intensive, diversified and unique: almost poetic, comparable with an exciting story. Hamburg based Diynamic-Head Solomun noticed their talent and character which led to their appearance on the second 2DIY4 Record. After Releases on labels such as Diynamic, 2DIY4, Cityfox or Culprit, stay tuned for upcoming stuff on some of the most influential Imprints of the current electronic music scene.

Shaun Reeves is an enigmatic pioneer who’s trailblazing quest to export his unique brand of cosmic underground house and techno from his hometown of Detroit to Europe and beyond has brought him international acclaim. Alongside best friends Ryan Crosson, Lee Curtiss and Seth Troxler he has helped put a warm, esoteric spin on the city’s musical heritage taking it away from clinical minimalism, back towards warmer, more spiritual party music. Together they have formed Visionquest, a genre-busting four-piece DJ combo, live act, record label and forward-thinking school of thought. 

Since his move to Berlin, Shaun Reeves has been enthralling audiences on both sides of the Atlantic with his own highly distinctive mixture of American house, both classic and contemporary, and the deepest, most cutting edge aspects of post-minimal techno and tech-house. In addition to playing in Berlin's celebrated Panorama Bar, Watergate, the legendary Beatstreet loft parties and holding his ‘Soul Shower’ summer residency at Club Der Visionaere, he has appeared at DC10 (Ibiza), Fabric (London), Robert Johnson (Frankfurt), Cityfox (Zurich), Sankeys (Manchester) and played for Wolf+Lamb at The Marcy Hotel (NYC).
