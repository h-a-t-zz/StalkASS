          Time to bring back the "big game" for the beginning of summer. All Facebook people and their Facebook friends are welcome to join. Let's move to the large grass area adjacent to the Stanford Soccer Field so we won't have to fight for space. Also, a later evening time should be cooler to boot -- no pun intended. Bring your cleats or turf shoes. We'll provide the soccer ball and goals.

          "Grindhouse" comes out on Friday in select theaters.  It's a double feature by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriquez.  The reviews are already quite good and, besides, Tarantino is a god.

My roomy and I are going to see it on opening night.  Let me know if you'd like to come.  We can do the City or Mountain View depending on who's interested.

          D is the fourth letter of the alphabet. It enables awesome words such as:

1) Desserts - yum!
2) Drinks - to be drunk
3) December - kicking off the month right
4) Delicious - which will be at this event
5) Dimsum - which will not be at this event

(So non-D letters don't feel left out, here are some other excellent terms:)

Cupcake - what I'll be making (with Sprinkles mix.) Also the name of my cat. Cat-allergic people beware!
You - bring yourself, maybe a friend, maybe a drink or dessert to sweeten the deal

Love my cat?

Come and watch SuperBowl XXLVI** in HD with some company and also some of Cpiro's famous southern cooking* 

Feel free to bring drinks/snacks, although we'll have stuff in stock.

It's reasonable to assume that my apartment can fit up to 15 people around the TV*** 

* only one of these adjectives is true.
** this roman numeral is entirely fictional. 
*** would this be comfortable?
