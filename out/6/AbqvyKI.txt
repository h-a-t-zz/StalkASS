Hey guys!

We're stoked to share that SPIN premiered our third single "Want My Love" this morning which we're releasing under Neon Gold as part of our debut EP out later this summer!

You guys helped us get our first singles "Unbound" and "Harlem" to the top of Hype Machine's no remix list by hearting and sharing.  If you guys dig the new single, we'd love your help taking "Want My Love" to the top as well!

           Hey guys!

We’re thrilled to announce that we've released our 2nd single “Harlem” this morning which Neon Gold calls “a breathless, quixotic dream.” 

Thanks to your support, our first single "Unbound" hit #1 on Hype Machine and has since garnered over 300k plays on Soundcloud and over 300k Youtube views! We could never have done it without you.

We'd love your help in getting back to the top of the charts with this release so if you dig it please favorite and share our latest jam!  We promise more to come soon :)
