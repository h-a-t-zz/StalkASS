BELLS ATLAS
===========
kaleidosonic soul punch ⚡ afro-soul, rhythm pop-sicles ☄ taste the r'nbow //// missy elliot meets bjork meets the Malian-born love child of david longstreth and annie clark ☀... or something like that

"With hypnotic, layered guitars on 'Bling', pitter-patter rhythms on 'Future Bones' and a psychedelic mishmash that Goat would be proud of on 'Sugar for the Queen', the California band sound alluringly exotic.  Throw in Sandra Lawson-Ndu's breathy, soulful vocals and they're the complete mystical package."  -NME Magazine

"Drenched in the echoes of many lovely tones, Bells Atlas‘s new EP Hyperlust is a victory of layered construction. Comprised of four members, all of them steeped in genres like bossa nova, latin psych-rock and African high-life, the group paints canvases of sound on each of the EP’s four tracks, creating a collage of precise guitar, woozy keyboards and wild vocals..." - OKAYPLAYER

"One of the most outstanding and challenging new bits of music I've heard this year [...] I was simply fascinated by a sound filled with choral harmonies and influences that could include Béla Bartók or Ornette Coleman or Talking Heads."  - Bob Boilen, NPR Music

Led by songwriter Hamilton Ulmer, Makeunder wrestles diverse tastes - from Renaissance motet, to art rock, to 90's R&amp;B, synth pop, soul, &amp; modern orchestral music - into powerful songs about death, survival, migration, &amp; loss.

Come ghost-dance to the songs of Great Headless Blank at Leo's Music Club, and help Makeunder celebrate the release!


FELL RUNNER
