          Howdy thar!

I'm hosting a pre-party for the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival on Saturday.

We're going to get started early so we don't miss any of the good music.

Festivities:  We're going to get a picking session and drinking games going before we head over to Golden Gate park, which is walking distance.

Food:  We'll provide bagels and coffee for everyone for breakfast, and beers.

Music:  Anyone who plays an instrument should bring it.  We're going to get a song list and circulate it, so write on the wall if you want in and we'll send it out in an email.  Also, if you have any songs you want to play, email them or post them on the wall so we can get the lyrics and chords together and send them out to everyone.

           A 1 mile subsidy has many perks.... pollution-free commutes,  a nearby Facebook community to loan you sugar or give you back your missing underwear from purple tie.   

And best of all,  PI x5280^2 of drinking sq. ft.....not to mention an easy and SAFE stumbling distance home.

We're organizing 9 golf holes at Facebook houses within the mile.

The overarching theme of the golf tourny is "East Coast Data Center."  Each house can select a theme with a matching shot, cocktail, or non-alcoholic beverage.  Costumes strongly encouraged.    

Some 'east coast data center' theme examples could include: Long Island (Ice Teas), Colonial Cocktail, West 'Egg Toddy' Gatsby theme, Manhattan, Boston Sidecar Racing theme, Yankee Clipper Sailing

At each house visitors will spend about 30-45min with the house hosts, and then move onto the next hole.

This will be a lot of fun and a great chance to hang-out!  New hires and interns, hope you'll come!

           Do you like to sing? I find singing to be a very joyful activity. I feel like it’s a great way to express my happiness. And you guys make me happy. So I thought a great way to celebrate my 26th birthday would be to bring all my friends together and sing with them. 

So I’m inviting you to a sing-a-long. I’d love for you to join. You might be thinking “Oh I’m not very good at singing,” but that’s ok. The question I asked was not “Are you good at it?” It was whether you like doing it. And I imagine a lot of you do actually enjoy the act of singing, even if you might feel a little embarrassed about doing it. Well, now’s an opportunity to get over that fear (without being drunk at a karaoke bar) and connect with your friends through song. It’ll be fun! 

We'll sing songs from a variety of genres, accompanied by guitar (Dillon Petrillo and Detti Quattrone have graciously offered their musical skills for the event). So far, I’ve got lyrics printed out for:

Animal by Mike Snow
Sitting on the Dock of the Bay by Otis Redding
Don't Worry Be Happy by Bobby McFerrin
Champagne Supernova by Oasis
Wonderwall by Oasis
Let It Be by the Beatles
Cecilia by Simon and Garfunkle

and I’m looking for suggestions! What do you like to sing? What do you sing in the shower or in the car when nobody’s watching? Let me know and I’ll print out lyrics so we can all enjoy belting it out. Add your suggestions here: https://

           Did you know how special June 30 is? On this day:

* The Immortal Seven issue the Invitation to William (continuing the English rebellion from Rome), which would culminate in the Glorious Revolution.
* The Tunguska event occurs in remote Siberia.
* The first leap second is added to the UTC time system.

...and much more! WOW!

~~~

To celebrate all of these, let's hang out, barbecue, listen to good music on awesome portable speakers, go on short hikestrolls, hang out at a small playground or two, look at ducks in the lake, and whatever else you guys bring to do! (also there's a basketball court and big flat plot of grass in which one could play soccer and many other things around! http://

We'll be bringing a tent for kid(s?) to (maybe???) nap in if they are tired, some food and a few toys.

RADICAL SELF-RELIANCE! If you think this will be nicer with some more things, bring them!

There's a lot of space around this lake, so let's expand and spread out (!)!

Oh, and food -- this will be a potluck; there are grills that we'll be using so you can bring stuff for that, or whatever else you'd like. But bring something!

okcool cya all!
