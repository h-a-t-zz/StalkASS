          Shea, Travis, and Ricky are all going to be in town this weekend. I was thinking maybe old and new friends should get together for a little afternoon BBQ in the park. I think they are all going off trailblazing the following day so get some park love in if you can. It's a little far off now for a menu to be announced but rest assured Dan and Dave don't usually slouch in this department. No worries Leah and Erin veggie options will be available. Invite who you want and come get some love.

          Next Monday, we will be diving into Chapter 5: Recursive Structures and Processes. We will explore recursion in a variety of contexts, moving towards settling on a definition for ourselves.  

I've decided to postpone a week to give myself and others time to really wrap their heads around this sectionâ€“ so if you've been missing out, now's the time to catch up!

Plan to meet up at 7 to mingle and order take-out, discussion will begin at 7:30.
