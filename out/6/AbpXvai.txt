          For this pre-Burning Man installation of Tutu Tuesday, we invite Werd co-founder Nick Williams tu the decks.  His smooth, sultry orchestration of techno tracks has been moving crowds into ecstatic states on a weekly basis at his Sunday night party alongside Kevin Knapp, Brandon Wade, and JTL.

Maintaining a strong musical alliance with his fellow Werd residents, Nick and Atish share a lot of similarities in taste as well.  It is sure to be another cohesive night of fluffy fanfare and your last chance to snag a tutu in time for the burn.

Innovative Disruption Threatens to Disruptively Innovate New Models of Fun
BREAKING NEWS

San Francisco, CA—False Profit, LLC, a disruptive local innovator and innovative local disruptor has made headlines today with the news that it plans on “disrupting the living fuck” out of all known and unknown models of innovation at its next event. When reached for comment, spokesperson and Chief Disruptor Amanda Dunn noted that “Previously, corporate activity in our sector has largely focused on disrupting known models and innovating within existing structures. At Spring Training 2014, investors will learn what it means to disrupt unknown models outside of any formally recognized structure of innovation.” 

As is their industry-defying practice, the company employed no consultants in the creation of their new strategy. “Basically, we just want to disrupt and innovate and maximally leverage growth opportunities and audience engagement. And we certainly didn’t need help from outside groups to begin exploring the modalities of the unknown unknowns that we see as key to our future operations,” said Alexander Warnow, the company’s Director of Subliminal Obfuscations. 

While the company considered providing free, wifi-enabled shuttle buses to bring investors to the event, they reconsidered after a new analysis indicated that the buses were the sole cause of rising rents across the Bay Area.

Rishi (New York)

A product of the 90's U.S. industrial scene, Rishi's initial inspiration for electronic dance music came out of the U.K. progressive movement as then crafted by the likes of jocks such as Danny Howells, Lee Burridge, Ashley Casselle, Sasha and John Digweed. 

It wasn't until the credit market meltdown of 2007 that he was finally able to tame his alter ego Wall Street lifestyle and focus on mixing records.  

Today his sound transcends the spectrum of electronic dance music ranging from tech house to minimal and beyond with many records in his box dating back almost 20 years.  

Simply put, he plays music to make you move and will trash 300 records without hesitation to find the one that will set the dance floor ablaze.

Peakkontrol's Insatiable Hunger for music has always been Deep in his Core but it was not until 2002 when he picked up his first pair of Technichs.

That his DJ Journey really Began. Inspired by Amazing friends (112 Crew) Dennis Rodgers,Matt licatta,Bill Patrick, Tommy and the Mayor* AKA Diego Tabango

He has engulfed himself in this Celestial Adventure.

His Dedication as a DJ is to lift the human spirit through music.

Peakkontrol drinks in a wide range when it comes to his mixing.

          Thanks to everyone for making the Return of Tutu Tuesday such a huge success.  We are happy to know that you missed us as much as we missed you!  

This month, we welcome Keith Kraft to the stage for his tutu debut.  Keith is a talented man with style for days--always armed and ready to take a theme party to the next level.  His music interests are vast but, when he confronts the dance floor, his selections are consistently sexy and packed with attitude.  

The Tracy Piper is bringing her live painting back for another round and Eye C Photography is hosting the newly minted Tutu Studio.  

We are playing on the sexier side of cute at Harlot every 2nd Tuesday.
