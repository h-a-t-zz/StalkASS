          Come have some drinks at the Nut House and some weedz at Perry's/my casa this Friday, the 24th anniversary of the  birth of my favorite person.

Details on exact timing will be forthcoming, but the Nut House is like 5 blocks from my house, so you can just plan to be in this general vicinity at some time around/after 8:00.
