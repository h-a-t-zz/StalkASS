           Makeunder is an experimental pop band from San Francisco. They'll perform never-heard-before material from their two works-in-progress, "Dirt Flooding the Streets" and "The Great Headless Blank."

Joining the Underlings is the fantastic string-informed indie group This Can't End Well.

The two groups will be playing in the lovely antique shop &amp; private venue, Viracocha.

           San Francisco's FIRST-EVER massive-muse! What's it look like when SF does a massive groupmuse? It looks like 100+ people in a huge creative gallery space fusing with an epic string quartet to produce a ballin' BYOB arts party. Heron Arts is the space that's hosting, and they're located in SoMa. The music will be Schubert's string quartet, "Death and the Maiden," which opens with a violent, anguished scream of terror and struggle, then moves through the mythic process of death and resurrection. Or whatever. Tickets are only $10 online and $15 at the door. http://grpm.us/

The 20th century was the great era of equality. Humankind narrowed many of the traditional gaps between rich and poor, between men and women, and between different countries and ethnic groups. Yet the 21st century may re-open some these gaps with a vengeance.

First, breakthroughs in biotechnology may for the first time in history open substantial biological gaps between rich and poor. As medicine moves from healing the sick to upgrading the healthy, humankind might split into several biological castes.

Secondly, as humans learn how to manufacture not only tools and products, but also organs and cells, immense new gaps might open between the most advanced countries and the less developed countries. In the 19th century, the few countries that mastered steam, oil and electricity subjugated all the rest. In the 21st century, the few countries that will master the production of bodies and brains will conquer the planet, while the rest of humankind might well be driven to extinction.

Dr. Yuval Noah Harari lectures at the Department of History, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His current research focuses on macro-historical questions: What is the relation between history and biology? Is there justice in history? Did people become happier as history unfolded? His most recent book is Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. The book surveys the entire length of human history, from the evolution of Homo sapiens in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the twenty-first century. It has become an international bestseller, and has been translated into close to 30 languages worldwide.
