Come out to Old Pro for a pint or two to celebrate.

Trying to invite everyone to one of these things is ridiculous, so if you can read this you're invited.

           Come get a drink with The Spring! Why? Because it's hump day. Because it's the day before Halloween. Do you really need a reason?  We'll be there from 5:30 onwards.  Let's hang.

You can do good just by dining out! With The Spring, 3% of what you spend at participating restaurants funds community projects. Plus, you get 3% cash back as a way of saying thanks. It's kind of a no-brainer! https://
