          Come celebrate spring with Sugarbear! The weather is getting warmer, it's officially ice cream season, and we've been using the extra daylight to bring you some all new flavors!

Try our brand new Root Beer ice cream, its like a root beer float all in a scoop. Or there's our refreshing and floral Lavender Matcha, as green as Bernal Hill. If chocolate is more your thing, you've got to try Double Dark Chocolate, super-rich and made with a double dose of Callebaut dark chocolate. Finally, due to popular demand we're bringing back an old favorite, our delicious Horchata ice cream. 

Swing by Mateo's for a well-deserved dessert and try them all!
