          Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-Liang: you will love him or hate him for this bizarre melange of artsy, dialog-less long takes of urban alienation, zany 60's style musical numbers, and watermelon porn.

There will be assorted delicious watermelon-themed snacks.

           I am so excited to share this musical awakening with all of you that I'm preparing a month ahead. Please come join the party at Slim's on Sat, January 21 to celebrate my birthday and one of the greatest displays of Yacht Rock this world has ever seen. 

Down for a little Hall 'n Oates? How about some Styx? Well, glue on your finest fake mustache, pull that sailor hat and floaties out of the closet and roll on down to Slim's for some celebration and uber-classy music. 

I have been fortunate enough to see Mustache Harbor a couple times and can guarantee it will be a good time. Great music, good friends, cheap drinks and a very long Sunday morning for you to recuperate. 

My main reason for sending this out a month in advance is because tickets to the show are $15 and I would hate for the night to sell out and you to get stuck outside. If you think you want to make it out, please don't procrastinate - our friendship may be in the balance. 

Hope you can make it. If not, no sweat, there will be many more birthdays to celebrate. And fake mustaches to be worn.
