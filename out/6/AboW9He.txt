          Join us as we bid farewell to Sarah and Julio in one final night of revelry at Rosewood before Sarah moves to Austin and Julio to Rio de Janeiro. 

Come early to hang out and chat over some of the best drinks in the city and stay late to party into the night. We'll be in the back room at Rosewood and will have free drinks until 11pm, so don't come too late.

         Science of Meditation, Attention and Anxiety with Philippe Goldin, PhD.

           There is an explosion of scientific interest in the effects of different forms of meditation training and how they reduce suffering and enhance well-being especially in people suffering from anxiety.  Methods from both clinical science and neuroscience have been used to explore the attentional and cognitive mechanisms by which meditation practices impact the brain and modify symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.  In this talk, we will practice specific contemplations together, examine the evidence for how such meditative practices modulate brain circuitry and psychological functioning, and engage in a lively discussion of the role of meditation, attention and anxiety in our society.

This will be a very special class taught by Philippe Goldin, PhD, Psychology Department, Stanford University.

Philippe Goldin, Ph.D. spent 6 years in India and Nepal studying various languages, Buddhist philosophy and debate at Namgyal Monastery and the Dialectic Monastic Institute, and serving as an interpreter for various Tibetan Buddhist lamas. He then returned to the U.S. to complete a Ph.D. in Psychology at Rutgers University where he trained as a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist. He is currently a research scientist and directs the Clinically Applied Affective Neuroscience group in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University (http://

          Causes is wrapping up a 2-day Hackathon with a blowout Happy Hour. Some of the things you might see on Friday:

- Live music
- Helicopter races
- Beer pong
- More vodka than you know what to do with
- a gorgeous sunset from the Causes porch
- some of the unfinished projects from the Hackathon

We would love to have you bring your friends, spouses, pets, roommates, neighbors and anyone else you want to party with and come join us for a night o' festivities. The kegs will be tapped. The vodka will be on ice. Hope you can make it. 

Following Happy Hour, Chan's band, Red Weather, will be playing an 11pm show at Hotel Utah, where most of us will probably end up.

          Fulfill your New Year's resolution to be more healthy and then undo it with a delicious bagel. After waking up before noon on a Sunday, you will have earned it! Here's the plan:

--Meet in Duboce Park, outside the Harvey Milk Center for the Arts
--Go on a 3 mile run through the Panhandle to Golden Gate Park. Very comfortable "talking" pace; all running levels welcome! (We can form a cohort for a longer/faster route if there is demand).
--End at Katz' bagels on 16th St. for delicious bagels - on Moishe House!

Because social obligation is the best commitment mechanism for exercise... You should come! We're counting on you to show up and move your tuchus!

She is also an initiated shaman, diviner, and healer with over four decades of specialized training in shamanic technologies and related fields.

Participants in our discussion will gain insights and skills in cultivating higher levels of awareness and creativity and have a chance to discuss with Marti what is actually happening in the brain and body when we push the edges of our human potential?

Marti holds a BA in biochemistry from Harvard University, an MFA in graphic design from the Yale School of Art and Architecture, and has advanced training in neurophysiology, psychology, and anthropology. She was president of her own design firm for 20 years.
