Inspired by meetings at the School of Mathematics, a natural and stress-free environment where anyone can study, discuss, explore, and experience mathematics. (http://thewe.net/
          
          
          
          
          
          math).

"For it is clear that these studies are like ladders and bridges that carry our minds from things apprehended by sense and opinion to those comprehended by the mind and understanding, and from those material, physical things, our foster-brethren known to us from childhood, to the things with which we are unacquainted, foreign to our senses, but in their immateriality and eternity more akin to our souls, and above all to the reason which is in our souls."
