           Please join us for the opening reception of Street Opera, an exhibition of still photography from Khalik Allah, at Heron Arts from 6-9pm!

Khalik Allah's Street Opera is a vivid and visceral portrayal of urban life and the human characters that inhabit it. Shooting at 125th and Lexington in Harlem, Allah's street photography gives a powerful glimpse into the spirit and character of those living in poverty. 

The evening will also feature performance by live jazz quartet Acme Anvil Drop.

Heron Arts is pleased to present this work in association with Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, as an opening reception for their afternoon screening of Allah's film work Field Niggas. View Field Niggas at  Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Saturday August 15th, 4-6pm.

Description
"We create a fun, interactive space for people to come together, share their passions, skills, dreams, and find support from their community.

"We map our collective resources so we can make connections and help get ideas off the ground. We build relationships and a network of support- a place where asking for help is not just OK, but essential. This is a place to bring your dreams, your crazy ideas, your on-hold projects- the things you cannot do alone. We're here for you!

"Inspired by Community Supported Agriculture where supportive relationships are forged directly between the community and local farmers, Community Supported Everything encourages and enables mutually beneficial relationships within our communities. We create spaces for neighbors to share their ideas, find support and offer their talents to incubate projects that benefit the community as a whole."

Some stories:
.........
#1
It's 1946. Dmitriy Shostakovich has just had his Symphony no. 9 censured by Soviet authorities. He has written a new string quartet, the haunting and challenging No. 3. For its premiere, most likely so that he would not be accused of "formalism" or "elitism," Shostakovich renames the movements in the manner of a war story:

Blithe ignorance of the future cataclysm
Rumblings of unrest and anticipation
Forces of war unleashed
In memory of the dead
The eternal question: Why? And for what?

.........
#2
It's 1980. In twenty years, NASA will commission you to take sounds of space and weave them into music. This sounds will come from plasma wave receivers flown on a variety of Milky Way spacecraft over a period of 40 years. That is yet to come: for now, you are writing Sunrise of the Planetary Dream Collector. It is an improvisational piece, inspired by a whimsical idea: each day, a dream collector collects the dreams of all the planet's sleepers, and redistributes them again next day. You write the composition for the Kronos Quartet, your new collaborators. It is in Dorian mode, in fourteen-beat modules (because seven!). They players choose the modules they are inspired to play.

Dan Sherman:

 Dan Sherman lives with his cats, the godfather of his cats and a cool Swiss chick in San Francisco. He is originally from Wisconsin, the home of Leinenkugel beer, which is unfortunately not sold in San Francisco. In addition to being a human, a friend to many and possibly a foe to a few, Dan is also DJ and a producer. He is a resident DJ for Qoöl. He is also a resident DJ for Concept, an event series he helps run with good pals Will Spencer and Alex Blackstock , and a co-founder of Sui Generis, an event series that brings electronic music artists who’ve never been to San Francisco, to San Francisco. Dan has released a few remixes on Loöq Records and is planning to release his first EP of original productions on the same label towards the end of 2014.
