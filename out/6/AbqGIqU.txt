          Our birthdays are two days apart so we are celebrating them together for one sole purpose: ROMEO MUST DIE.

Just kidding...Romeo will be SAKE BOMBING, duh!

Not to mention, come to congratulate all of our Facebook half marathoners who will complete the Nike Women's event in SF THAT morning :)

          We take (jacuzzi) baths sometimes. Srsly. 
(bengal kitty) Tiger blood runs through our plumbing.  
We like blingin' gold sharks. 
(Skyfarm's our new post-hippie coop in the Mission. It's awesome.)

Slee &amp; Roddy, among others, will be spinning.
We might even have some live music.
Come warm the farm with yr favorite chikens!

          three of us are having birthdays:

Josh 10/5
John 10/12
Matt 10/19

so we're having a party at Matt/Josh/Bob's house on Sunday October 14th - starting around two. kegs and food. 

UPDATE: people are asking about the actual time - whether it's really 2-10 or actually starting later/ending earlier. I don't know - I just made the times up. 2 sounds good to start eating/drinking so show up sometime after that and plan to bail whenever you want.

          Come settle in for an afternoon of boat racing, beirut, shuffleboard, billiards, table tennis, set, sauna, and swimming. 

We are pretty lazy, so we'll probably just get a keg of michelob ultra and order pizzas, so if there is anything more exotic you'd like let me know in advance or bring it yourself.

           Holy Crap.  This will be the best party you have EVER been to.  Yeah, I said it.  Bold?  Maybe.  But when have I not backed up something I've said?  

We are having a massive paint party.  Our house is being knocked down in September by our landlord and we have permission to do whatever we want with our walls.  So we are inviting all of our friends to come and paint the hell out of our walls. We will also have 12-15 artists, including graffiti artists and muralists painting along with you.  There won't be ONE inch of white left on the walls.  

We will be shooting a short film to show the transformation of the spaces that you will be able to see online a couple weeks after the party.

This is a party you're not going to want to miss!  Please RSVP to me, and tell me how many you are bringing.  We can only fit so many people in the house!   

No cover charge--we were originally collaborating with someone for a fundraiser, but no longer.  Just bring yourself, and if you are really awesome, bring a 6 pack with ya!
