          Happy Birthday to me! The Andrew development team has been hard at work, and they're hitting their April 30th release deadline for the twenty-sixth straight year. New features include:

- more pleasant user interface
- greater stability when networking
- bug fixes

You'll admit that there are few more appropriate ways to celebrate my birthday than to spend three hours drinking beer on a week night. Who knows what kinds of hilarious conversations we'll be having by the end of it.

Come on out next Monday night to Shotwell's (at 20th and Shotwell, just past South Van Ness) - they have the best beer menu in the Mission, a pool table, and a jukebox.

yeah.(!)

          It will be warm in June so that means it's time to river rat.  Floating, drinking, shotgunning on sandy islands, losing sunglasses...all part of the fun.

          ---------------

Directions:
Public Trans:
2 bus lines run close by and 2 different ones are available past 1am.
the 48 (which runs down 24th street) drops off at the intersection of
hoffman, 22nd street, and grand view. just get off, make a right onto
grand view, and head a block over.

the 33 (which runs down 16th and 18th streets) drops off at Market and
Clayton. Get off, and walk left (up the hill) onto Market. Make a left
onto grand view (which intersects market at stanton)

the 24 castro/divisadero is just down the hill and runs all night.
Also, at night, the L bus runs up and down Market.

the castro muni station is also close by.

Biking:
If you are coming from the Mission, the best way is to go up 22nd
street to Chattanooga. Make a left onto Chattanooga then make a right onto 24th street. Go up 24th street until you hit Douglas, 3 blocks up from Castro. Make a right onto Douglas
and then a left onto 21st st. Take 21st to the dead end 2 blocks up,
and make a right up the ramp onto Grand View.  Our house will be on the left
almost immediately.

Another *easy way to bike here is to go up Market from the Castro. The
road slowly climbs and makes a couple of curves. After Clayton, you
will see Short St.; cross over to the other side of Market and go up the
sidewalk to Grand View. Alternatively, stay on the right side of
Market until you see a cement footbridge that goes over Market, and
cross that. Make a left onto Romain when you get down from the bridge and make a right onto Grand View at the stop sign.

*relative to your skill and health in biking up SF Hills

Driving:
take 18th street past the castro and up the hill. make a left on
Eureka (2 blocks above castro) and a right on 21st. Take 21st to the
dead end 2 blocks up, and make a right onto Grand View.

From the West side of town, take Portola until it turns into Market
and make a Right on Romain. Make a right at the first stop sign to get
onto Grand View.

           I've always wanted to do the JeJune Institute tour of San Francisco -- it appears to be some sort of new agey science cult but actually it's a crazy scavenger hunt/puzzle/mystery walk around san francisco. 

It takes about 2-3 hours. Apparently this is a pretty dope way to explore some lesser noticed parts of San Francisco. 

And my birthday is coming up, so Je June and Zeitgeist will perfectly merge in this epic afternoon and eve.

I made a reservation Sat. 11/20 for a group of 12-15 or so people to go, starting at 12:30 at the Institute.  I'm sure we can wildly push the boundaries on this. Join us for the tour or stop by Zeitgeist later, where we'll be downing the bubbly and hoping and praying the tamale lady stops by.


See you there &lt;3

           i really want to go check out that 'house of the future' that popular science &amp; sunset magazine built. maybe you do too. i'm going to go this weekend and thought maybe i could talk some fellow ubergeeks into joining me. check out the website, which is probably more compelling.
