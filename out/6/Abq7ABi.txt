           we're turning older -- come hang out at our place to celebrate.

the easiest way from palo alto is sand hill to 280N.  see http://tinyurl.com/

beware, our house is sunken off the side of the road. you have to walk down a (hairy, unkempt) staircase by our mailbox and go to the door that looks like it's not actually someone's front door. that's ours.

carpooling is probably a good idea, as there is limited parking and the house is on kind of a windy road.

          i have a fireplace and i want to christen it now that it's cold enough. this is also an excuse for the game night i've been talking about for months. might as well throw some snacks in there while we're at it. 

date's still tentative but will probably be within that week. feedback welcome. more details to come.

          Programming's easy, fun and rewarding. I'm putting together a mini-series to share that joy.

We're going to go from zero experience to dynamic web apps (a.k.a. "websites") in Python in 3 or so parts. This is meant to get you going and doing simple stuff and give you the confidence to mess around on your own afterwards - most people never get past that initial hump, so we'll do it together.

It's going to be at the Sub - we'll keep it fun and have some beers after - but I do ask that you only come if you're committed to learning this stuff. It's going to take serious effort and concentration to get the most of it, and we probably won't be building concretely useful things until the second session. 

Tentatively pencil in the remaining two parts: 
- 8/1 
- 8/8

Open to date changes if a lot of people can't make it. Of course, you don't have to come to all three, I won't be offended, but I will try to build up to a coherent endpoint where you can actually do some cool things. 

y4y for bending computers to your will!

PS: existing coders, if you feel so inclined, come &amp; help me TA to make sure nobody falls behind.
PPS: didn't invite too many to keep it manageable but don't feel shy about signing on.

Bring some beers &amp; bubbly if you're so inclined (and brown bags, if the rumors are true).
