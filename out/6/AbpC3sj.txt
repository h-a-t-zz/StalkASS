Brett Amory / APEX ONE / Pakayla Rae Biehn / Anthony Discenza / Double Zero Annie Vought and Hannah Ireland) / Jeremy Fish / Casey Gray / Desiree Holman / Chris Johanson / Jet Martinez / Alicia Mccarthy / Alia Penner / Andrew Schoultz  / Dave Schubert / Jen Stark / Zio Ziegler

and  Creativity Explored artists Andrew Li, John Patrick McKenzie, and Kate Thompson

curated by Tova Lobatz and Jenny Sharaf

Open bar refreshments include custom Espolon Tequila cocktails and other fine Campari beverages, as well as the finest PBR money can buy, and we'll have Señor Oz (Afrolicious) gracing us with his talents on the turntables all night long.

The SUB presents "Last Thursdays", a monthly showcase of new work by visual, musical &amp; culinary artists who inspire &amp; expand our community. 

Friends, please join us on July 30th for the FINAL Last Thursdays of 2015!  After 7 amazing months, this season is finally coming to a close.  Help us celebrate the finale by welcoming new works by A photography and Painting exhibition featuring a collaboration between artists Christine Lloyd, Emma Fineman, and Sam Hylton, whose one-month artist residency in Iceland served as a springboard for this month's body of work, "Samgöngur".   As always we'll have an open bar, delicious snacks, and further soundtracking from popstack for your enjoyment.

For the project, Emma, accompanied by photographer Sam Hylton, traveled the ring road utilizing Iceland's incredible landscape to produce a body of photo works which feature Christine Lloyd and Fineman as models juxtaposed against these dreamlike settings.  According to Emma, "our focus was to produce images that seem to be remembered in an abstract way, or even imagined, as opposed to directly witnessed (all involve some means of transport).  The representation of both Lloyd and Fineman as identical (or nearly identical) shows their familiarity to one another, while also heightening the attention paid to their subtle differences. All of which calls attention to the notion that they are visitors, that as humans they have an intimate connection and relationship to one another, but that they are foreign travelers in these landscapes. As humans we are disconnected from what used to be our world. A world that at one point we lived in harmony with, but now there is disparity. The barrenness and abandonment of these no longer functional or relevant means of transport - derelict plane that has now become a ruin, bottomed out functionless boat, and abandoned bus, shows how our technologies have failed us, they have lead us to a bleak place of removal from what was once our home and is now wasteland."
