           Hello NEDsters!

Check out our Janurary 19th talks:

Matty Sallin
Why You Should Automate Your Finances, and How To Do It

Why is it so hard to be responsible about our finances?  We are all born with cognitive biases that make saving money and planning for the future difficult.  In this talk, I will discuss learnings from behavioral economics on why we are bad at finance and I will show you how to automate your finances so that you can save, pay off debt, and have enough money for your bills without having to manage your money manually. 

Sloane Joie Trugman
The Rise of the Information State

Do you know how that access to connectivity comes to you? Do you ever challenge what "privacy” means?  Does spooling data into the zephyred air make you feel protected by your state leaders?  Together, we will explore the metaphor of the alien by studying two great songs about sharing and observance - "Loving The Alien" by David Bowie and 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' by Radiohead.  We are perhaps the "aliens" that we have feared and created all along. 

When?
Talks will begin at 7:30pm sharp, so come at 7:00 to mingle and find a good seat. Please bring snacks, beverages, and fellow nerdels.

           Join us at Quora's new headquarters in downtown Mountain View on Friday 6/14 from 11am to 2pm. Open to the public.

East and South Asians are underrepresented in the national bone marrow registry. Help Nina, William, Rajesh and others you may know by spreading the word about registering, especially to folks who work near downtown Mountain View. 10 minutes and a cheek swab is all it takes. See you Friday!

Nina, William and Rajesh need your help and are in urgent need of a matching marrow donor.

NINA POLVANICH LOUIE - savenina.com
Nina was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in September of 2012.  She endured 7 rounds of aggressive chemotherapy at UCLA to treat the disease, but after only two months of remission, the lymphoma recurred in her brain.  A Stanford and Harvard alum and a Texas native, Nina is the loving mother of a two year-old son and has less than 2 months to find a bone marrow donor.

WILLIAM TSE
William is the brother of Marvin Tse, a Googler.  William, 24 years old, went to college at USC and received an offer from KPMG to start in the fall. Unfortunately he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AML) in January 2013. He is in urgent need of a marrow transplant. This procedure is William’s only hope for his long-term survival.  

RAJESH SHARMA
Rajesh has an aggressive form of lymphoma that can no longer be treated with chemotherapy.  He's a member of the legal team at Genentech, and they've reached out to us for help.  Rajesh is a wonderful husband and a doting father to his 8 year old daughter.  His best chance of cure is finding a match ideally from someone of South Asian descent.  This procedure is Rajesh's last chance for survival.


Are you East Asian or South Asian?
If you are East or South Asian, please strongly consider joining the registry.  Nina (Chinese-Thai), William (Chinese) and Rajesh (Indian) are minorities and there is a severe shortage of minority donors in the national registry.  Patients will mostly match with a donor within the same ethnic group. 

What is involved in registering? 
It takes 10 minutes to register and the entire process is painless.  A sample of your tissue type is collected by a swab of cheek cells. Your tissue sample will be sent to Be The Match registry and use the results to match you to patients.

In addition, you would need to:
- Be between the ages of 18-44 (Patients have much higher survival rate from donors in this age group)
- Fill out a consent form
- Provide a cheek swab
- Commit to donate to any patient 

What is the donation process? Does it hurt?
In the past, Bone Marrow Extraction was the sole technique available and required a needle to extract bone marrow from inside of the pelvic bone. The procedure was done under general or local anesthesia so the donor felt no pain, though it was possible to have slight lower back soreness for a couple days. 
 
Today, the majority of donations today do not require surgery. In the PBSC (peripheral blood stem cell) procedure, your blood is filtered to extract bone marrow stem cells. The experience is similar to donating blood. Read more at http://www.aadp.org/
          
          
          
          
          
          donation-process/
 
How long does it take to donate marrow?
The Peripheral Blood Stem Cell process takes 6-8 hours over 1-2 days. Most donors report the worst part is boredom. :) 
 
Don’t I need my bone marrow?
You sure do. But only 5-10% of a donor’s bone marrow is donated, and your body naturally replenishes its supply within a couple weeks.

          Join us in Black Rock City to welcome Shabbat with ecstatic singing, creative ritual, and a hot veggie meal. BYO plate! 

All peoples, dusty spirits, and holy troubadours are welcome! 
Invite your friends, your lovers, your angels, and your neighbors. 

Come to our large dome as Friday's sun sets. Once there, you'll welcome the Shabbat eve while a sea of twinkling stars envelops you, and our public shade-structure transforms from daytime misting cloudscapes to light installations. We'll fire up our sound responsive LED beacon to help guide anybody who hasn’t found their way, as all our singing voices set it to a communal pulse of light. 

After we've sung exaltations, praises, and ancient love songs, you'll be gently guided to the dining area and sat at communal bedouin-style tables. We'll fill your cup, nourish you with a multi-course feast, and ease you into the embrace of a subtle sound environment. Later, once our souls and stomachs are nourished, our camp will blossom into a celebratory dance party with klezmer-mashups and global bass booms.

The evening will begin with a cocktail and hors d'oeuvres reception featuring an "in conversation" with composer Mason Bates and SFS Special Projects Director Susan Key. A small, private viewing of an orchestra rehearsal conducted by Donato Cabrera will follow.

Mason Bates is a distinguished and innovative American composer of symphonic tunes. During the reception he will preview the March 16th Davies After Hours concert, which will feature the American Mavericks: Michael Tilson Thomas, Emanuel Ax, and John Adams. The private rehearsal viewing is truly a rare opportunity.
