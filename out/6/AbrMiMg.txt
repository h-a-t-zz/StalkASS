           Songza is very happy to be curating a free night of live music at the Brooklyn Night Bazaar on Saturday January 4th headlined by Songza’s New Artist of the Month for January 2014, Magic Man.

If you’re not familiar with BK Night Bazaar, it’s a combination night market, bar, game room (mini golf, ping pong) and music space that was recently listed as #1 on Brooklyn Magazine’s “Brooklyn 20: Winter 2014" list.

p.s. We’ll also be at BK Bazaar on Friday January 3rd to co-present with MyFreeConcerts.com if you’d like to come join us for what’s sure to be a great night as well: https://

           Makeunder is an experimental music band out of San Francisco, led by singer and instrumentalist Hamilton Ulmer. The project began with a vision: fill a diverse pool of musicians to explore the very thin line between the grandiose and intimate, the traditional and radical, the familiar and the rare.

"Bursting with tension and exhaultation equally, on 'Radiate, Satellite' it's difficult to discern whether Ulmer is on the verge of smiling the biggest grin or breaking down into a hearty cry."
- Impose Magazine

"This is folk music with soul. Tales of weddings, fragments of youth, technological developments and a lament for the now quaint way of farming. This is highly thoughtful music."
- Bitzl-R

Glass Gavel is an experimental art rock band from San Francisco.  Their phantasmic sound paints dystopian apparitions and unwritten fables about our modern world.  Led by Bay Area guitarist and composer Van Jackson-Weaver, their debut EP is slated for release in the Spring of 2013.

Freighter is a technical thrash trio with a penchant for peanut butter sandwiches.
